The government’s film tax relief generates almost £12.50 for every £1 spent and provides crucial support for UK films and filmmakers – it is a shrewd investment for the UK.</p><br/><br/>  <p>Britain’s film and creative industries give us much to be proud of, with British stories as diverse as Spectre and Suffragette winning the hearts and minds of audiences across the world while creating jobs and investment at home.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The creative sector tax reliefs, alongside lottery funding through the BFI, are a catalyst for creativity and innovation in storytelling in UK independent film, and are a key ingredient in the UK’s winning combination of outstanding talent and skills, world-leading studios and facilities, and iconic locations, which attracts film production from around the world.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Adrian Wootton, chief executive of the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.britishfilmcommission.org.uk/"">British Film Commission</a>, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>The UK’s creative sector tax reliefs have been a tremendous success, attracting inward investment through film, television and animation while stimulating growth in jobs and infrastructure across the UK, from London, Bristol and Manchester to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The boost they give our domestic screen industries is crucial, since the money generated by major inward investment titles helps create further training and business opportunities which allow our own independent productions to thrive, thus maintaining the UK’s status as a cultural powerhouse that is both creative and highly profitable.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Independent UK productions of all budgets have benefited from the film tax relief, receiving a third of total government support.</p><br/><br/><p>The UK film industry’s cutting edge skills in the fields of visual effects, sound production and world-class studios are making the UK an even more attractive place to make films. For example, the UK is home to many of the world’s leading VFX companies including those behind award-winning films such as Gravity.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as its creative and technology companies, the film industry relies upon a variety of sectors from catering to security, who have also felt the positive effects of the tax relief. BFI figures show that film production supports around 40,000 full-time jobs in the UK, which is a 22% increase from 2009.</p><br/><br/><p>Introduced in 2007, the film tax relief was extended to 25% for films of all budget levels on 1 April 2015 to support UK film making. The relief is available to films which qualify as British productions through a cultural test or via an official UK co-production treaty.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""key-facts-and-further-information"">Key facts and further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Based on UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief, there was an increase of 25% in industry investment into our creative economy in comparison to 2014.

Recent James Bond box-office smash Spectre was a UK produced – US financed film shot around the world, and across the UK, which is expected to be amongst the highest grossing films of 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Other upcoming inward investment releases will include Eddie Redmayne’s venture into JK Rowling world of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the live action version of Beauty and the Beast and Knights of the Round Table: King Arthur. Plus Star Wars: Episode VIII, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Untitled Matt Damon/Bourne Sequel, The Jungle Book, The Lost City of Z, The Huntsman: Winter’s War.</p><br/><br/><p>The billion dollar Star Wars franchise is committed to making the new trilogy here in the UK and in addition to filming has set up a new Visual FX facility house.</p><br/><br/><p>Pinewood have since announced a £200 million expansion to double the size of its existing studios adding new stages, workshops and production offices to accommodate growing demand for UK productions.</p><br/><br/><p>Suffragette has been a success at the UK box office.

For people in the UK it is 0800 595 000.  People can also email <a href=""mailto:customs.hotline@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk"">customs.hotline@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>. There is no need to give personal details, and information that leads directly to an arrest could be considered for a small reward.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan, 61, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested at a swimming pool in Valencia on 10 August by the Guardia Civil. He fled the UK 12 years ago after being found guilty of smuggling 28.3 million cigarettes into the country. His crimes robbed the UK of around £4 million in duty and he was sentenced in his absence in December 2001.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan was part of a wider conspiracy to smuggle around 56 million cigarettes into the UK between November 1999 and March 2000. Ten other men were involved in the plot, which robbed the UK taxpayer of over £8.2 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Adrian Farley, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">McGowan is finally facing UK justice after 12 years on the run. We are determined to pursue fugitives and ensure they face the consequences of their criminal activity. HMRC would like to thank the Spanish authorities and UK organisations that assisted with this operation.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The call to ring 900 988 922 comes as smugglers try to make huge profits from illegal imports of cigarettes, and the selling of low-quality, counterfeit cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol.</p><br/><br/><p>Customs officers are also keen for information about other items such as drugs, firearms, obscene material and endangered species. Tax frauds that HMRC want to hear about include betting and gaming, money laundering and the ‘carousel’ VAT scam in Europe.</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Smugglers and fraudsters cheat the rest of us by not contributing the tax that pays for schools, hospitals and public services”, said an HMRC spokesman.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">People in the British expatriate community can help us to find them.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/></div></p>",

In memory of the late MP and in support of the tremendous work she undertook to back good causes, the government will make a charitable donation equivalent to the VAT payable on the sales of the single to the Foundation.</p><br/><br/><p>Speaking at the Treasury Select Committee, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Jo Cox dedicated so much of her life to helping people less fortunate than herself and the charity named in her honour is carrying on that excellent work. It is only right that we do what we can to support that work and I am pleased to confirm that every single penny of sales from this single will go towards the good causes the Jo Cox Foundation supports.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The government has previously waived the VAT on the X Factor winner’s Christmas single, Save the Children single, Band Aid Ebola single, 2011’s Military Wives Choir single, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake appeal single.</p><br/></div></p>",

The residual meal is largely used for incorporating into animal feed and can be zero-rated. The zero rate also applies to the actual seed when it is to be used as animal feed or for sowing.</p><br/><br/><h4 id=""flax"">3.4.2 Flax</h4><br/><br/><p>These varieties are grown for the resulting fibre.

Miscellaneous</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""plant-growing-kits"">6.1 Plant growing kits</h3><br/><br/><p>Plant-growing kits or plant-starter kits typically consist of seeds, growing medium and some form of container, together with fertiliser and an instruction leaflet. Such kits are generally standard-rated regardless of whether the seeds are of a kind which would normally be zero-rated.</p><br/><br/><p>But the kit may be zero-rated provided the seeds are zero-rated and the:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>standard-rated element of the kit (for example, growing medium, fertiliser and pot) accounts for less than 10% of the total cost</li><br/>  <li>planting medium, which is impregnated with edible vegetable or fruit seeds, is no more than a means of simplifying the planting of the seeds (for example, peat cubes of less than 125cc impregnated with seeds, or thin layers of tissue incorporating seeds)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""mushroom-growing-kits"">6.2 Mushroom growing kits</h3><br/><br/><p>The VAT treatment of mushroom growing kits will depend on the type of container in which the kit is supplied. If the kit is supplied in a cardboard carton, the whole supply is zero-rated, as this is normal and necessary packaging.</p><br/><br/><p>But if the kit is supplied in a plastic bucket or similar reusable container, the spawn and the growing medium are still zero-rated and VAT must be accounted for on the value of the container and any other packaging costs. This is because it is a mixed supply of both standard-rated and zero-rated items. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700"">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a> gives more information about this.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""your-rights-and-obligations"">Your rights and obligations</h2><br/><br/><p>Read <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-charter"">Your Charter</a> to find out what you can expect from HMRC and what we expect from you.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""help-us-improve-this-notice"">Help us improve this notice</h2><br/><br/><p>If you have any feedback about this notice please email: <a href=""mailto:customerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk"">customerexperience.indirecttaxes@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll need to include the full title of this notice.
