The importance of collaboration between US, EU and G7 in response to the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty was underlined. The European Council was in agreement that further infringement on Ukraine sovereignty would lead to broader trade and economic sanctions.</p><br/><br/><p>Asked about travel bans and asset freezing, the <abbr title=""Prime Minister’s Spokesperson"">PMS</abbr> said that preparatory work was underway and was being discussed by senior officials in London and in the EU. The European Council had agreed that there was an urgent need to establish dialogue between Ukraine and the Russian government to de-escalate the situation. The meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers on Monday and the one between Russian Foreign Minster Lavrov and John Kerry were important opportunities for this to be taken forward.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""syria"">Syria</h2><br/><br/><p>Asked about talks on Syria between the Prime Minister and John Kerry, the <abbr title=""Prime Minister’s Spokesperson"">PMS</abbr> said discussions centred on continuing to work closely on the removal of chemical weapons and support for a political transition, which included support for moderate political elements, through the Syrian National Council. On chemical weapons, the Russian government’s commitment to the timetable for their removal was significant.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""pence-tax"">40 pence tax</h2><br/><br/><p>Asked about 40 pence tax, the <abbr title=""Prime Minister’s Spokesperson"">PMS</abbr> reiterated the Prime Minister’s position on tax policy.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""scotland"">Scotland</h2><br/><br/><p>Asked about whether on his trip to Scotland the Prime Minister would ask the Scottish government to repay the money paid for the Health Service Award, the <abbr title=""Prime Minister’s Spokesperson"">PMS</abbr> said that it was for the First Minister to explain why he was not making savings that can be re-invested in front line services.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

It’s an easy way to help your charity or community amateur sports club (<abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr>) maximise the value of donations.</p><br/><br/><p>To claim Gift Aid, you must be recognised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>) as a charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> and you’ll need to ask donors to make a Gift Aid declaration.</p><br/><br/><p>In certain circumstances, some payments made to charities which are not strictly gifts, like membership subscription paid to a charity, may be treated as donations for Gift Aid purposes.</p><br/><br/><p>If any donor or person connected to the donor benefits significantly from their donation, it doesn’t qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""the-benefit-rule"">The benefit rule</h2><br/><br/><p>When someone makes a donation, you might want to give the donor something in return (an item or service) to say thank you. This is known as a ‘benefit’. Literature that tells donors what your charity does eg a newsletter or a simple plaque to thank a donor, doesn’t count as benefits.</p><br/><br/><p>The value of a benefit is always the value to the recipient, not the cost to your charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr>. For most benefits, the value is simply the retail value of the item or service.</p><br/><br/><p>If you can’t find out the retail value of an item or service, you must work out how much someone would be prepared to pay. You could, for example, look at the value of similar items or services. Where a benefit is attendance at an event that is not open to the public, the value of the benefit is the cost of the event divided by the number of guests.</p><br/><br/><p>You can claim Gift Aid on the donation if the value of the benefit doesn’t exceed certain limits, for example:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donation</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefit</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£101 - £1000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>These rules still apply when the benefit is given to a family member or a company run by the donor.</p><br/><br/><p>The benefit rules apply to different types of donation, like <a href=""#charity-auctions"">charity auctions</a> and <a href=""#charity-events"">charity events</a> and may affect the amount you can claim.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>You must keep a record of Gift Aid donations you receive and all benefits that were given to donors as a consequence of their donation.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><h2 id=""when-gift-aid-cant-be-claimed"">When Gift Aid can’t be claimed</h2><br/><br/><p>You can’t claim Gift Aid on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>payments for goods and services</li><br/>  <li>donations of money from a company</li><br/>  <li>gifts made on behalf of other people, for example, a <a href=""#membership-subscription"">membership subscription</a> paid on behalf of somebody else</li><br/>  <li>gifts that come with a condition about repayment</li><br/>  <li>gifts that come with a condition that the charity buys goods or services from the donor</li><br/>  <li>payments received in return for goods or services for example  <a href=""#admission-to-a-concert"">admission to a concert</a> or a fee for a sponsored challenge</li><br/>  <li>a ‘minimum donation’ where there is no choice about payment</li><br/>  <li>gifts made using ‘charity vouchers’ or ‘charity cheques’</li><br/>  <li>donations received before the date that <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> accepts your organisation as a <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> or a charity for tax purposes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""sponsored-challenges"">Sponsored challenges</h2><br/><br/><p>If your charity organises fundraising events such as marathons or treks abroad, you may be able to claim Gift Aid on sponsorship that participants raise.</p><br/><br/><p>All sponsorship payments are eligible for Gift Aid if participants pay the cost of flights and accommodation themselves.</p><br/><br/><p>Example:</p><br/><br/><p>A donor signs up for a sponsored bike ride in Vietnam which costs £1,500 for flights and support costs. The charity asks the donor to raise £2,500, of which £1,000 goes to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>Where sponsorship payments are eligible for Gift Aid, sponsors must make a valid <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/gift-aid-declarations-claiming-tax-back-on-donations"">Gift Aid declaration</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>The deposit or registration fee that participants are asked to pay in advance of a sponsored challenge is not eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If a sponsor is connected to the participant, their donations only qualify for Gift Aid if the participant pays the full cost of the trip so that all the sponsorship money raised goes to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>A ‘connected person’ is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>a wife, husband or civil partner</li><br/>  <li>a brother, sister, parent or grandchild</li><br/>  <li>the wife, husband or civil partner of a relative</li><br/>  <li>a company under the control of the donor, or under control of connected persons</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> recognises that a charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> cannot be expected to check whether a participant and their sponsors are connected. But you should take reasonable steps to ensure that Gift Aid payments are not received from people or companies connected to a participant. You can do this by including an explanation in any event literature and on the sponsorship form.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""membership-subscription"">Charity membership fees</h2><br/><br/><p>To qualify for Gift Aid, charity subscription payments must be for membership only. They must not give members personal use of the charity’s facilities or services.</p><br/><br/><p>These conditions still allow members to:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>receive newsletters you produce to explain your charity’s work</li><br/>  <li>visit and view the work of your charity</li><br/>  <li>take part in activities that form part of your charity’s objectives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""community amateur sports clubs"">CASCs</abbr> can’t claim Gift Aid on membership payments because members are given personal access to the club’s facilities or services.</p><br/><br/><p>Charity and <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> membership fees do not qualify for the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/claiming-a-top-up-payment-on-small-charitable-donations"">Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme (GASDS)</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>Gift Aid can’t be claimed on a subscription payment paid on behalf of someone else. This is because it’s considered a gift to the person whose membership is paid, not to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>However, if the membership of a charity is paid for a child (under the age of 18), payment is accepted as a gift and is eligible.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""professional-organisation-membership-fees"">Professional organisation membership fees</h2><br/><br/><p>Membership subscriptions paid to some professional organisations on <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/professional-bodies-approved-for-tax-relief-list-3"">list of qualifying bodies</a> can be treated as an expense deduction. Working members can claim tax relief on their subscription, but subscriptions can’t be treated as Gift Aid payments.</p><br/><br/><p>Retired or student members’ subscription fees can be treated as a Gift Aid payment, but they must confirm that they don’t have income from which they can deduct professional membership subscriptions.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""church-collections"">Church collections</h2><br/><br/><p>You can’t claim Gift Aid on donations collected in your church that will be passed directly to another charity. This is because the money collected is not part of the church’s income.</p><br/><br/><p>If a church chooses to set up a fund to raise money for a charity, then the money collected forms part of the church’s income. In this case, the church (which is a charity in its own right) must claim any Gift Aid due.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""selling-donated-goods-on-behalf-of-individuals"">Selling donated goods on behalf of individuals</h2><br/><br/><p>This process is exclusive to charity shops that operate a retail Gift Aid scheme to sell goods on behalf of donors. To maximise the amount that is raised, charities can sell valuable or collectable items donated to a shop at a commercial public auction or an online auction website.</p><br/><br/><p>Money raised by selling donated goods like clothes does not qualify for Gift Aid. You need to explain to owners of donated items that the shop, auction or website will act as their ‘agent’ to sell goods on their behalf if the owner will give the sale proceeds (minus any commission charged) to the charity as Gift Aid donation.</p><br/><br/><p>If you operate a charity shop, staff and volunteers must explain the arrangements before donors complete a form appointing you as their agent.</p><br/><br/><p>The owner has the right to keep all of the proceeds from the sale of their goods. They can choose to donate all or part of the amount. You can claim Gift Aid on the agreed amount after any commission (including VAT) has been deducted.</p><br/><br/><p>The owners of donated goods will usually make a Gift Aid declaration when they ‘sign up’ for the scheme, before their goods are sold.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""operating-retail-gift-aid"">Operating Retail Gift Aid</h3><br/><br/><p>There are 3 ways of operating ‘Retail Gift Aid’:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the Standard Method</li><br/>  <li>Method A</li><br/>  <li>Method B</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If shops are operated by the charity directly, then the charity can use the Standard Method or Method A. Charity shops that are run by a trading subsidiary company of a charity can use Method B. If shops are operated by a separate entity such as a company, then any method can be used.</p><br/><br/><p>The Standard Method allows an individual to take goods to a charity shop and agree that the shop will act as their agent in selling the goods (the shop will deduct a commission). The individual must fill in a Gift Aid declaration at this stage, if the charity does not already hold one from the individual. The charity marks the goods in some way so that the sales proceeds can be linked back to the donor.</p><br/><br/><p>After the goods are sold (but before the charity makes a Gift Aid claim) the charity shop writes to the owner of the goods to advise them of the net sale proceeds. <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> provides template letters for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-claim-template-letter-standard-method"">the Standard Method</a>, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-the-end-of-year-method-a"">Method A</a> and <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-the-end-of-year-method-b"">Method B</a> for you to download, print and use.</p><br/><br/><p>Other template letters are available for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Method A for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-when-100-limit-is-exceeded-method-a"">where the £100 limit has been exceeded</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>Method A <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-sales-above-the-100-limit-method-a"">where subsequent sales are made after the £100 limit has been exceeded</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>Method B for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-sales-above-the-1000-limit-method-b"">sales above the £1,000 limit</a><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The charity shop must give the individual at least 21 days to respond to this letter before it treats the net sale proceeds as a donation to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>How each method works is explained in more detail in <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s detailed guidance on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-detailed-guidance-notes/chapter-3-gift-aid#chapter-342-claiming-gift-aid-when-goods-are-sold-by-and-the-proceeds-gifted-to-charities"">Retail Gift Aid</a>. If you want to claim Gift Aid in this way, you must read the guidance to make sure you meet the conditions of the scheme.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""keeping-records"">Keeping records</h3><br/><br/><p>You must keep all documentation related to claims on the proceeds from the sale of goods on behalf of individuals, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the donor’s dated Gift Aid declaration</li><br/>  <li>a copy of any written agreement with the donor that shows the charity or its subsidiary can sell goods on their behalf</li><br/>  <li>documentation to show that the individual has been notified of sale proceeds where required</li><br/>  <li>accounting records to prove that items belong to an individual</li><br/>  <li>if the goods are sold by a trading subsidiary, records to show how the sales proceeds are sent to you</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Charities are advised to maintain records of staff and volunteer training and guidance, to prove that they’re implementing the process correctly.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""charity-events"">Charity events</h2><br/><p id=""charity-events"">If you sell tickets to an event you’ve organised, eg a concert or fundraising dinner, payment does not qualify for Gift Aid. Even if the ticket price is higher than the cost of the event, the money made from ticket sales counts as profit and not a donation.</p><br/><br/><p id=""admission-to-a-concert"">To qualify for Gift Aid, a payment must be a voluntary donation and not be a compulsory payment for attending an event.</p><br/><br/><p>Minimum donation payments don’t qualify for Gift Aid. But if someone chooses to pay more than the minimum donation, the extra amount paid qualifies for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If you set a ticket price for an event and also ask for a suggested donation, the donation is eligible. You must make it clear to people buying a ticket that they can attend without making a donation, but you mustn’t give preference to those who do give a donation.</p><br/><br/><p>If you arrange a ‘donation only’ event where people can attend whatever they decide to give (including making no donation), then all donations would qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""viewing-charity-property"">Viewing charity property</h2><br/><br/><p>Entry fees to visit and view your charity property don’t qualify for Gift Aid because they are not a gift. But a voluntary donation that allows visitors to view your property may qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations qualify when they:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>are 10% or more than the normal admission fee, or</li><br/>  <li>allow admission for at least 12 months</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>You must offer visitors a choice to pay the normal entry fee only or the admission price plus a donation at the time of entry.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><h3 id=""information-you-must-provide-to-visitors"">Information you must provide to visitors</h3><br/><br/><p>Visitors must receive the same right of admission whether or not they pay a donation.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll need to clearly advertise their normal entry fee and make it clear to all visitors that they will be allowed entry when they pay the lower admission charge if they choose not to make an additional 10% voluntary donation.</p><br/><br/><p>You can explain the choice to pay the standard entry fee or the 10% or more donation amount on your admission signage and website. The options should be explained by staff or volunteers at the time of asking for payment.</p><br/><br/><p>If you don’t give visitors a clear choice to pay the standard entry fee or make a donation of 10% or more, then any payment that exceeds the standard entry fee by 10% or more is not a freely-given gift. In this case, payment would not be eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""when-visitors-pay"">When visitors pay</h3><br/><br/><p>When a visitor voluntarily agrees to pay a donation of 10% or more, you must ask the donor:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>is the donation for entry by members of the donor’s family only</li><br/>  <li>for a written or verbal Gift Aid declaration</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If the visitor gives you a verbal declaration, you must give them written confirmation and keep a record for yourself. This is usually included as part of the payment receipt issued with entry tickets, eg on the till receipt.</p><br/><br/><p>For visitors who choose admission for at least 12 months, you have 2 options:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>accept a donation and allow free admission for all visits during the period (minus up to five days a year when free entry doesn’t apply)</li><br/>  <li>accept a donation and grant a right of admission on payment of a reduced fee, which must apply to all visits during the period (only the initial donation qualifies)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""terms-and-conditions"">Terms and conditions</h3><br/><br/><p>A voluntary donation that allows visitors to view your property will not qualify for Gift Aid if the terms and conditions attached to an admission fee include a right to a full or partial refund of the payment. For example, in the event of bad weather, cancellation of an exhibition or mechanical failure of an exhibit.</p><br/><br/><p>This is because under the Gift Aid scheme a donation cannot be repaid under any circumstances.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""expenses-paid-to-volunteers"">Expenses paid to volunteers</h2><br/><br/><p>If the expenses are reasonable, you can reimburse a volunteer for costs they have had to pay because of their work, eg, train fares.</p><br/><br/><p>Once you pay a volunteer, they can keep the money or pay part or all of it back to the charity as a Gift Aid payment.</p><br/><br/><p>Gift Aid only applies when the volunteer makes an actual payment of money to your charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr>. You can’t claim Gift Aid if a volunteer decides not to claim for expenses that they’re entitled to.</p><br/><br/><p>If you pay expenses to a volunteer which are higher than the costs incurred, the payment may be taxable as employment income if it can be shown that they’re employed. If this can’t be proven, the payments may be chargeable as a miscellaneous receipt.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""charity-auctions"">Charity auctions</h2><br/><br/><p>When the retail value of an item bought in a charity auctions exceeds the benefit limits, Gift Aid can’t be claimed.</p><br/><br/><p>It is possible for the donor’s payment to be split between an amount to ‘buy’ the item and an amount that can be treated as a gift. To do this the value of the item auctioned is subtracted from the amount paid. The remainder is treated as a donation that can qualify for Gift Aid. You must make the value of the item clear to bidders at the auction before each item is sold.</p><br/><br/><p>For an item that’s not commercially available, supporters at a charity auction may pay more than its retail price to increase their donation or because the item is unique. The commercial value of a football shirt, for example, is increased if it’s signed by the football team. The benefit for Gift Aid purposes is the amount it fetches in the auction.</p><br/><br/><p>The benefit is calculated as follows:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donations</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefit</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£101 - £1000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><h3 id=""when-the-donation-exceeds-the-benefit-limits"">When the donation exceeds the benefit limits</h3><br/><br/><p>When the value of the benefit exceeds the limits in the donor benefit rules, the donor can ‘buy the benefit’.</p><br/><br/><p>For the donor to ‘buy the benefit’, and enable you to claim Gift Aid, you must make them aware of the retail cost of the item (the value of the benefit) and that they can buy the item elsewhere when they make their successful bid (donation).</p><br/><br/><p>This ‘excess donation’ qualifies for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>In some cases, supporters can bid on services that donors promise to carry out for successful bidders, like a massage or childcare. To be eligible, the amount that the successful bidder pays for the ‘promise’ is the same as the value of the benefit. If a ‘promise’ is commercially available, the value of the benefit is the same as its retail price.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""donations-to-schools-charities-involved-in-running-schools-and-educational-trusts"">Donations to schools, charities involved in running schools and Educational Trusts</h2><br/><br/><p>Only voluntary gifts or payments are eligible for Gift Aid, simply describing a payment as ‘voluntary’ or a ‘donation’ does not make it eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If access to educational services or facilities provided by a school requires a payment to be made by parents or relatives of students, payments are not ‘voluntary’ and therefore they are not charitable donations.</p><br/><br/><p>If parents or relatives are asked to make payments of ‘voluntary contributions’ to a school or school charity, which are linked to the provision of services or facilities to related pupils, they are not charitable donations.</p><br/><br/><p>Payments made for tuition fees, school holidays, extra-curricular activities, lessons, educational trips, or tickets for a school production are not eligible for Gift Aid. This is because these payment are not voluntary gifts, and a student receives a benefit paid for by a relative.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations made to an appeal or for a specific charitable purpose of the school, may be eligible for Gift Aid. Donations must not be linked to the provision of any benefit to a student related to a donor.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations given for non-uniform days, sponsored events, building appeals and equipment appeals will usually qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""educational-school-trips"">Educational school trips</h3><br/><br/><p>Head teachers may not charge parents for any school trip that is part of the national curriculum. However, the head teacher may ask for a voluntary contribution towards a trip. The children of parents who do not contribute must not be discriminated against.</p><br/><br/><p>Voluntary contributions are eligible if:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>they’re non refundable even if the trip doesn’t go ahead or if their child does not go on the trip</li><br/>  <li>any benefit (for example, travel costs, trip insurance, cost of entry) does not exceed maximum levels of allowable benefit for the donation</li><br/>  <li>the school tells parents that the contribution is not compulsory</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Example 1:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution requested by school</th><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution actually made</th><br/>      <th>Amount eligible for Gift Aid</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£10</td><br/>      <td>£15</td><br/>      <td>£5</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>Example 2:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Cost of trip to a museum</th><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution requested by school</th><br/>      <th>Amount eligible for Gift Aid</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£8 (transport £5, entry £2 and brochure £1)</td><br/>      <td>£10</td><br/>      <td>£0</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>In this case, the amount doesn’t qualify for Gift Aid because the benefit of £8 (80%) exceeds the 25% limit on benefits because:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donations</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefits</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£100 to £1,000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/></div></p>",

Here are 4 examples.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""active-substance"">Active substance</h3><br/><br/><p>A chemically defined substance, a chemically defined group of substances, such as alkaloids, polyphenols or anthocyanins, or a plant extract. Active substances must have medicinal properties to prevent or treat specific diseases and ailments, or their symptoms.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""comparators"">Comparators</h3><br/><br/><p>Drugs that are used in trials that compare new drugs with previously available ones. They contain active substances and are defined as medicinal preparations.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""medicinal-preparations"">Medicinal preparations</h3><br/><br/><p>Preparations based on one or more active substances that have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. In other words, that cure, treat or prevent diseases or ailments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""placebos"">Placebos</h3><br/><br/><p>Products that do not contain active substances and so are not defined as medicinal preparations.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-placebos-with-food-ingredients"">Classifying placebos with food ingredients</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances and so, for the most part, they’re not classified in Chapter 30 as medicinal preparations. Instead they’re classified according to their contents.</p><br/><br/><p>If they contain food substances, or ingredients with nutritional value, no matter how little, then they’re covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106. This heading code covers ‘food preparations not elsewhere specified or included’ and would include, for example, tablets that contain a mix of food substances like sugar and starch. They could either be the only ingredients or they could be mixed with chemical items too.</p><br/><br/><p>There is an exception - placebos that are in the form of intravenous solutions that have a nutritional effect are classified in Chapter 30.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-placebos-with-chemical-ingredients"">Classifying placebos with chemical ingredients</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances, so they cannot be classified in Chapter 30 as medicinal preparations. They are classified according to their contents.</p><br/><br/><p>They often contain a mixture of chemical ingredients covered in Chapter 38 under heading 3824.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code covers ‘products of the chemical or allied industries (including those consisting of mixtures of natural products), not elsewhere specified or included’. For example this heading code would cover tablets made up of mixtures of chemical products.</p><br/><br/><p>If any of the ingredients is a food substance, or a substance with nutritional value, then the product cannot be classified in Chapter 38. Instead it’s covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""medicinal-preparations-of-placebos-and-comparators-used-for-clinical-trials"">Medicinal preparations of placebos and comparators used for clinical trials</h2><br/><br/><p>Comparator drugs contain active substances and are defined as medicaments - or medicinal preparations. These are preparations used (either internally or externally) to treat or prevent human or animal diseases or ailments. They’re covered in Chapter 30 under heading codes 3003 and 3004, depending on how they’re supplied. They must have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be classified under either heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>Medicaments that are neither made up into measured doses, nor packaged for retail sale are covered under heading code 3003.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading code 3004 specifically covers medicaments that are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>made up into measured doses - such as tablets, ampoules, syringes and capsules</li><br/>  <li>packaged for retail sale</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>It also covers placebos that are packaged together with medicinal preparations for retail sale - even though placebos are mainly covered in other chapters. This is because the active substances in the medicament part of the combined product (or set) satisfies the requirement that it should have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""intravenous-solutions"">Intravenous solutions</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos that are in the form of intravenous solutions which have a nutritional effect are also included in Chapter 30, either under heading code 3003 or 3004, depending on how they’re presented.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""exclusions-and-difficult-classifications"">Exclusions and difficult classifications</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos and comparators are classified in different chapters of the Trade Tariff, depending on their intended use, their ingredients and how they’re made up.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain active substances intended to treat, cure or prevent diseases and ailments are defined as medicaments and are covered in Chapter 30. Products that are made up of chemical ingredients are covered in Chapter 38. There are specific exclusions from each of these chapters.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-30"">Specific exclusions from Chapter 30</h3><br/><br/><p>To be covered in Chapter 30 a product must contain active substances and prevent, cure or treat diseases and ailments. Placebos do not contain these active substances and so, with a few exceptions, are classified elsewhere.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-38"">Specific exclusions from Chapter 38</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos that are made up from a mixture of chemical ingredients are covered in Chapter 38 under heading code 3824. If any of the ingredients is considered to be food, or has any nutritional value, then the product is excluded from this heading code and covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""nature-of-the-product"">Nature of the product</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos and comparators are used in clinical trials to test how effective an alternative drug is, or to compare a new drug with an existing one.</p><br/><br/><p>An important difference between placebos and comparators is whether or not they contain active substances that would define them as medicaments. Medicaments, or medicinal preparations, are products that are meant for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>therapeutic uses - they treat or cure a disease or ailment</li><br/>  <li>prophylactic uses - they prevent a disease or ailment from developing</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances and so they’re likely to be covered in Chapter 21 or Chapter 38, depending on their ingredients. Products that do have therapeutic or prophylactic uses are covered in Chapter 30.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""get-help"">Get help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

The majority of these commodities are covered in chapter 72 and chapter 73 of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide covers iron and steel products including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>iron and steel</li><br/>  <li>primary materials</li><br/>  <li>iron and non-alloy steel</li><br/>  <li>stainless steel</li><br/>  <li>alloy steel</li><br/>  <li>flat products</li><br/>  <li>long products, for example tubes, pipes, bars and rods</li><br/>  <li>ingots and semi-finished products</li><br/>  <li>specific finished products made from iron or steel</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If you wish to classify finished products use chapter 73, which contains detailed descriptions and classification codes.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying finished products you must carefully consider their function and application along with the composition of the metal as it’ll have an impact on finding the correct classification.</p><br/><br/><p>If the function or use isn’t intrinsic to the item - as it would be in, for example, a nut and bolt or radiator - you may have to classify it using a classification code defined by its composition, form and manufacturing technique in chapter 72.</p><br/><br/><p>The guidance that follows shows the classification choices you’ll need to make for common raw and semi-manufactured commodities using a graphical approach for ease of reference.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s essential to have as great an understanding of the details of the composition and form of your goods as possible in order to classify them correctly. For example, if you aren’t sure if your goods are flat rolled or cold rolled, you’ll not be able to classify them accurately. Check with your suppliers if you’re unsure.</p><br/><br/><p>The early pages in this section cover essential definitions and outlines of processes that will affect classification, while the later pages show you how to classify specific types of product in an easy-to-use flowchart format.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""how-iron-and-steel-are-classified"">How iron and steel are classified</h2><br/><br/><p>Classifying iron and steel products may appear daunting - chapter 72 and chapter 73 of the Tariff are dedicated to these products and are lengthy and detailed. However, adopting a logical approach to defining the products can help effective classification.</p><br/><br/><p>Iron and steel products cover an enormous variety of commodities, from base materials, through processed and semi-finished products to finished products.</p><br/><br/><p>At the less processed end of the spectrum, this guide covers primary materials of iron and steel, stainless and alloy steel, waste and scrap iron or steel, tubes, pipes, rods and bars and semi-finished products.</p><br/><br/><p>It also covers specific and detailed finished products made from iron and steel, such as barbed wire, nails and screws, containers and boxes, sewing and knitting needles, springs, radiators and kitchen and tableware</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""key-questions"">Key questions</h3><br/><br/><p>There are three key questions you need to bear in mind when you start classifying iron and steel products:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>What are the goods made of?</li><br/>  <li>What do they do?</li><br/>  <li>How do they function?</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>In most cases answering these questions fully will lead you to the correct classification code.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, a line pipe used for oil or gas pipelines made from stainless steel is reasonably easily classified using the answers to these questions.</p><br/><br/><p>You should take care to consider all these questions as the goods’ role and function can significantly impact the classification.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if you’re trying to classify a keyring that has a wire spring ring with a fob of metal or other material that is not functional, the classification will be that of the wire ring as an article of iron or steel wire. If the fob is functional it will be classified under its own heading.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""know-your-goods"">Know your goods</h3><br/><br/><p>As the classifications are detailed, it’s a good idea to get as much information about the goods as possible, particularly their composition and treatment. Having an understanding of production processes can also be very helpful in classification, for example knowing that spiegeleisen is generally obtained from ores and therefore classified under the same heading as pig iron - rather than a ferro-alloy as it’s often referred to in the trade.</p><br/><br/><p>If you’re in doubt, it’s very useful to check the details with your supplier as it’ll save time and effort at the classification stage.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""quick-reference-table-of-heading-codes"">Quick reference table of heading codes</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Pig iron and Spiegeleisen</td><br/>      <td>7201</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ferro-alloys</td><br/>      <td>7202</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ferrous products in lumps, pellets or similar forms</td><br/>      <td>7203</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ferrous waste and scrap</td><br/>      <td>7204</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Granules and powders</td><br/>      <td>7205</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ingots and other primary forms</td><br/>      <td>7206</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Iron or non-alloy steel semi-finished products</td><br/>      <td>7207</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Flat rolled products</td><br/>      <td>7208, 7209, 7210, 7211 7212</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Iron or non-alloy steel bars and rods</td><br/>      <td>7213, 7214, 7215</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Iron or non-alloy steel wire</td><br/>      <td>7217</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Stainless steel - primary or semi-finished</td><br/>      <td>7218</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Stainless steel bars and rods</td><br/>      <td>7221</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Stainless steel wire</td><br/>      <td>7223</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Railway or tramway track construction of iron or steel</td><br/>      <td>7302</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tubes, pipes and hollow profiles</td><br/>      <td>7303, 7304, 7305, 7306</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Reservoirs, tanks and vats</td><br/>      <td>7309, 7310</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Barbed wire</td><br/>      <td>7313</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Nails, tacks, drawing pins, corrugated nails, staples</td><br/>      <td>7317</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Screws, bolts, nuts, coach screws, screw hook, rivets, cotters, cotterpins, washers and similar articles of iron and steel</td><br/>      <td>7318</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Radiators for central heating, not electrically heated, and parts made from iron and steel</td><br/>      <td>7322</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Table, kitchen and other household articles of iron and steel</td><br/>      <td>7323</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><h2 id=""defining-iron-and-steel"">Defining iron and steel</h2><br/><br/><p>Using the correct terminology will assist in correct classification. These definitions are agreed across the <abbr title=""European Union"">EU</abbr> through the European Coal and Steel Community and used in the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>Throughout the Tariff, the expression base metals means:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>iron and steel</li><br/>  <li>copper</li><br/>  <li>nickel</li><br/>  <li>aluminium</li><br/>  <li>lead</li><br/>  <li>zinc</li><br/>  <li>tin</li><br/>  <li>tungsten (wolfram)</li><br/>  <li>molybdenum</li><br/>  <li>tantalum</li><br/>  <li>magnesium</li><br/>  <li>cobalt</li><br/>  <li>bismuth</li><br/>  <li>cadmium</li><br/>  <li>titanium</li><br/>  <li>zirconium</li><br/>  <li>antimony</li><br/>  <li>manganese</li><br/>  <li>beryllium</li><br/>  <li>chromium</li><br/>  <li>germanium</li><br/>  <li>vanadium</li><br/>  <li>gallium</li><br/>  <li>hafnium</li><br/>  <li>indium</li><br/>  <li>niobium (columbium)</li><br/>  <li>rhenium and thallium</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>It doesn’t include gold, silver and platinum and platinum group metals, that is, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium, which are proper to chapter 71.</p><br/><br/><p>Cermets are products containing a microscopic heterogeneous combination of a metallic component and a ceramic component. It includes metal carbides sintered with a metal.</p><br/><br/><p>Pig iron is the main primary product of the iron and steel industry. It’s classified under heading code 7201. To be classified under this heading code, it can be:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>alloy or non-alloy pig iron</li><br/>  <li>in the form of pigs, blocks, lumps (whether or not broken) or in the molten state (however, remember that heading code 7201 does not extend to shaped or worked articles such as rough or finished castings or tubes)</li><br/>  <li>brittle and unworkable, but this can be remedied by annealing (annealing is generally applied to cast items that are not classified under heading code 7201, although annealed primary forms (such as pigs or blocks) are classified under heading code 7201)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Spiegeleisen is classified under heading code 7201 as it is generally obtained directly from ores, despite often being referred to in normal trading as a ferro-alloy. It’s:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>used principally in steel manufacture (in the Bessemer process) to de-oxidise and recarburise the iron, and for alloying</li><br/>  <li>has a high manganese content - that is approximately 15%, but more than 6% and less than 30%</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ferro-alloys are used to add definite proportions of alloying elements to steel or pig iron in order to obtain special qualities. They’re classified under heading code 7202 if they’re in the form of pigs, blocks, lumps or similar primary forms, granules, powder form or in forms obtained by continuous casting, such as billets.</p><br/><br/><p>Ferro-alloys generally:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>contain 4% or more of the element iron and other elements</li><br/>  <li>contain less iron than in pig iron</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7202 also covers ferro-alloys previously reduced to granules or powders and made into briquettes, cylinders, thin slabs or other forms using cement or other binders, or in some cases exothermic additives.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s important to remember that heading code 7202 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ferro-uranium (heading code 2844)</li><br/>  <li>ferro-cerium and other pyrophoric (igniting spontaneously on contact with air) ferrous alloys in all forms (heading code 3606)</li><br/>  <li>products that in some countries are sometimes known as ferro-nickels or ferro-nickel chromes, and that are malleable and not normally used as ‘addition materials’ in iron and steel metallurgy (heading codes 7218 to 7229 or chapter 75)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ferrous products obtained by direct reduction of iron ore and other spongy ferrous products are classified under heading code 7203. Iron and steel products of this heading are produced by reducing the ore without fusion - known as direct reduction. They’re obtained from ore in lumps, granules, or from concentrated ore in briquette or pellet form and contain more than 80% by weight of metallic iron. They also have a spongy structure (sponge iron) and can be used in the production of steel.</p><br/><br/><p>In Tariff classification terms, when in briquettes or pellet form they shouldn’t be confused with those consisting of concentrated ores under heading code 2601 (the former differ from the latter by the shiny appearance of their cut surface).</p><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7203 also covers very pure iron having an impurity content not exceeding 0.06% but it excludes steel wool, which is classified under heading code 7323.</p><br/><br/><p>Ferrous waste and scrap are classified under heading code 7204. They’re generally used for the recovery of metal by remelting or for the manufacture of chemicals. Waste and scrap are a result of the manufacture or mechanical workings of metals, and metal goods definitely not usable due to breakage, cutting up, wear or other reasons. They take the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>crop ends, filings and turnings (from the manufacture or mechanical working of iron or steel)</li><br/>  <li>shearing or flame-cutting of heavy and long pieces</li><br/>  <li>compression into bales (particularly in the case of light scrap, using for example, a hydraulic press)</li><br/>  <li>fragmentation/shredding of vehicle bodies</li><br/>  <li>crushing and agglomeration into briquettes of iron and steel filings and turnings</li><br/>  <li>breaking up of old iron articles</li><br/>  <li>remelting scrap ingots such as products roughly cast in the form of ingots without feeder-heads or hot tops, or pigs having obvious surface faults and not complying with the chemical composition of pig iron, spiegeleisen, or ferro-alloys</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Granules (of pig iron, spiegeleisen, iron or steel) are classified under heading code 7205. Granules are products of which less than 90% by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 1 millimetre and of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 5 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>Granules remain under heading code 7205 whether or not they’ve been graded by size.</p><br/><br/><p>Granules include shot (more or less round in shape) and angular grits. Shots and grit are used for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>cleaning up and de-scaling</li><br/>  <li>surface hardening (shot peeling) metal</li><br/>  <li>polishing or engraving metal or glass</li><br/>  <li>working stone or like material</li><br/>  <li>sometimes adding to concrete as a hardener (or to increase its impermeability to X-rays or gamma rays)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7205 also covers wire pellets, produced by cutting iron or steel wire.</p><br/><br/><p>Powders (of pig iron, spiegeleisen, iron or steel) are also classified under heading code 7205. Powders are products of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 1 millimetre. They’re suitable for compacting or agglomeration.</p><br/><br/><p>These powders (including sponge iron powder) can be sintered into various items such as electromagnetic coils in telephony or magnetos, and used in the manufacture of welding electrodes and welding powders, reducing agents and pharmaceutical products.</p><br/><br/><p>Bear in mind that heading code 7205 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>radioactive iron powder (isotopes) (heading code 2844)</li><br/>  <li>iron powders presented as medicaments (heading codes 3003 or 3004)</li><br/>  <li>granules and powders of ferro-alloys (heading code 7202)</li><br/>  <li>waste filings and turnings of iron or steel (heading code 7204)</li><br/>  <li>small defective ball bearings, these aren’t considered to be shot as they have a more regular and finished appearance and are made of better quality steel (heading code 7326)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ingots are classified under heading code 7206. These are blocks of metal made by casting the liquid metallic contents of a furnace or crucible into open metallic moulds. Ingots are the raw material for the metal working process.</p><br/><br/><p>Other primary forms are classified under heading code 7206. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>steel in the molten state</li><br/>  <li>blocks and lumps (chiefly obtained from agglomerates or build-ups produced by a direct reduction of iron ore or by electrolytic deposition)</li><br/>  <li>puddled bars and pilings (after rolling, provide a product with a characteristic fibrous structure by virtue of its slag content)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, heading code 7206 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>remelting scrap ingots (heading code 7204)</li><br/>  <li>products obtained by continuous casting (heading code 7207)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Semi-finished products are classified under heading code 7207. These are defined as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>continuously cast products of solid section, whether or not subjected to primary hot rolling</li><br/>  <li>other products of solid section, that have not been further worked other than being subjected to primary hot rolling or roughly shaped by forging, including blanks for angles, shapes or sections</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products may not be in coils.</p><br/><br/><p>Semi-finished products include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>blooms - are larger than billets and are used for re-rolling to bars, rods, angles, shapes and sections or for the manufacture of forgings</li><br/>  <li>billets - are used for re-rolling to bars, rods, angles, shapes and sections or for the manufacture of forgings</li><br/>  <li>rounds - have a circular or polygon cross-section of more than four sides (they are used as intermediate products for the manufacture of seamless-steel tubes and differ from bars and rods in that they are usually supplied in lengths of 1 to 2 metres and their ends are often cut by a blow lamp, whereas bars/rods are normally more accurately cut)</li><br/>  <li>slabs/sheet bars - are rectangular (not square) in section and their widths are greater than their thickness</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>rolled products of solid rectangular (not square) cross section, which do not conform to the definition of semi-finished products, and are in the form of:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>coils of successively superimposed layers</li><br/>      <li>straight lengths that if of a thickness less than 4.75 millimetres are of a width at least 10 times the thickness; or if thickness is 4.75 millimetres or more are of a width which exceeds 150 millimetres and is at least twice the thickness</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/>  <li>those with patterns in relief derived directly from rolling (such as grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and those that have been perforated, corrugated or polished provided they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products other than rectangular or square, of any size are to be classified as products of a width of 600 millimetres or more, provided they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.</p><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products classified under heading code 7208 may be subject to surface treatment:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>7208 includes corrugated flat-rolled products</li><br/>  <li>7208 excludes ribbed products with an angular profile (heading code 7216)</li><br/>  <li>7208 excludes flat-rolled products which have been coated, plated or clad with metal, or coated with non-metallic substances (for example paints, enamels or plastics) (heading code 7210)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Hot rolled - this is a method of shaping steel by rolling. The temperature range depends on various factors such as the composition of the steel. For general guidance, the final temperature of the work-piece in hot rolling is about 900°C.</p><br/><br/><p>Cold rolled - this is a process which is carried out on products that have not been heated immediately prior to the cold-rolling operation in which they are reduced to final thickness. The objectives of cold rolling are to improve the surface finish and to obtain smaller and more uniform thickness than is possible in hot rolling. Cold-worked products tend to be very hard and possess great tensile strength.</p><br/><br/><p>Angles and shapes are classified under heading code 7216. These must have the following characteristics:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the sections most commonly falling in this heading are H, I, T, Z, U (including channels) capital omega, obtuse, acute and right L angles</li><br/>  <li>corners can be square or rounded, the limbs equal or unequal and the edges may or may not be bulbed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Alloy steel is defined as steel with additional metals. This is made by smelting mixed ores that may either be added with the steel in the furnace or in the molten bath near the end of the finishing period, in the ladle, or in the moulds.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes, the main ferro-alloys include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ferro-manganese</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silicon</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-manganese</li><br/>  <li>ferro-chromium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-chromium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-nickel</li><br/>  <li>ferro-molybdenum</li><br/>  <li>ferro-tungsten (ferro-wolfram)</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-tungsten</li><br/>  <li>ferro-titanium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-titanium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-vanadium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-niobium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-magnesium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-calcium</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Stainless steel is defined as alloy steel containing, by weight, 1.2% or less of carbon and 10.5% or more of chromium, with or without other elements.</p><br/><br/><p>Cast iron is iron mixed with other metals. The iron must predominate by weight over these additional metals. These additional metals must not be in the quantities stated for the chemical composition of steel - see the page in this guide on iron and steel metal composition.</p><br/><br/><p>Malleable cast iron is cast iron that under pressure or hammering can easily spread and flatten.</p><br/><br/><p>Spheroidal graphite cast iron is not considered as either a non-malleable cast iron (of heading 732510) or a malleable cast iron (heading 732599 first part), but is considered to be ‘a third category’ (within heading 732599 second part).</p><br/><br/><p>Forging is a process where the metal is formed into a shape by heat and pressure.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot-drop forging and drop stamping are methods in the production of metal shapes or sections (usually on a conveyor line) by the hot shaping of cut blanks in dies by means of special tools. These are carried out by pressure or impact, generally in successive phases, following preliminary operations of rolling, hammering, hand forging or bending.</p><br/><br/><p>Wire drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods in irregularly wound coils are drawn through one or more dies at high speed to obtain coiled wire of a smaller diameter.</p><br/><br/><p>Bright drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods, whether or not in irregularly wound coils, are drawn at slow speed through one or more dies to obtain products of smaller or different shaped sections.</p><br/><br/><p>Rolled or obtained by continuous casting is a method of casting molten steel directly into useful or semi-finished shapes.</p><br/><br/><p>Wrought means shaped by hammering or beating.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot extrusion is a process consisting of enclosing a piece of metal heated to forging temperature in a chamber (called a container). High pressure is applied to the metal which is then forced through a die.</p><br/><br/><p>Cold extrusion is a process similar to hot extrusion above except that the metal is at room temperature.</p><br/><br/><p>Dies are metallic or other permanent devices that provide a given shape to a piece of metal. The word in metallurgy covers a range of meanings and includes dies that are used to shape solid metal in presses and those for making die casting from.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot drawing is a process in which metal is heated and passed through a die to produce the finished shape.</p><br/><br/><p>Sintering is where compacted metal powder (obtained by moulding, usually coupled with pressing) is spread out and passed under a burner. The powder ignites. Air is then drawn through the powder causing any sulphur or carbon present to oxidise. This causes a partial fusion of the particles in the powder, leaving them to adhere together in the form of a porous cellular clinker known as a sinter.</p><br/><br/><p>Closed-die forging is where hot metal is shaped within the walls of two dies that come together to enclose the work piece on all sides. The process starts with a rod or bar cut to the length required to fill the die.</p><br/><br/><p>Open-die forging is the process of hammering hot metal between flat or contoured dies. There are three basic types of dies for this process - flat dies, V dies, and swage dies.</p><br/><br/><p>Annealing is the process of heating a metal or alloy to a predetermined temperature (below its melting point) maintaining that temperature for a time, then cooling it slowly. Annealing generally provides softness.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""about-iron-and-steel-treatments"">About iron and steel treatments</h2><br/><br/><p>It’s very useful to understand the different treatments used in the production of iron and steel products, whether they’re surface treatments, subsequent manufacturing or finishing.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""surface-treatments"">Surface treatments</h3><br/><br/><p>Cladding methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>pouring molten cladding metal onto the basic metal, followed by rolling</li><br/>  <li>simple hot rolling of the cladding metal to the basic metal</li><br/>  <li>any other method of deposition of the cladding metal followed by any mechanical or thermal process to ensure welding (for example electro-cladding)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Bear in mind that ferrous products clad with non-ferrous metals remain classified under chapter 72 provided that iron or steel is the predominating metal by weight.</p><br/><br/><p>Plating methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>coating with metal through immersion, hot-dip galvanising, tinning, hot coating with lead and aluminium coating</li><br/>  <li>electroplating, for example with zinc, cadmium, tin, lead, chromium, chromium/chromate, copper, nickel, gold or silver</li><br/>  <li>impregnation or diffusion by heating the product to be coated with the required coating metal in powder form, for example, sherardising (cementation with zinc), calorising (cementation with aluminium) and chromising (with diffusion of chromium)</li><br/>  <li>spraying - atomising the molten coating metal and directing the spray onto the product to be coated</li><br/>  <li>metallisation by evaporating the coating metal in a vacuum</li><br/>  <li>metallisation by bombarding the coating metal with ions in a glow discharge (ion plating)</li><br/>  <li>coating by cathode vaporisation (sputtering)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Coating methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>enamelling</li><br/>  <li>varnishing</li><br/>  <li>lacquering</li><br/>  <li>painting</li><br/>  <li>surface printing</li><br/>  <li>coating with ceramics or plastics, including special processes such as glow discharge, electrophoresis, electrostatic projection and immersion in an electrostatic fluidised bath followed by radiation firing</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""subsequent-finishing"">Subsequent finishing</h3><br/><br/><p>Finished products may be subjected to further finishing treatments such as mechanical workings (including turning, milling, grinding, perforation or punching) or surface treatments such as polishing, burnishing, artificial oxidation or chemical surface treatment.

In addition, there are all the different possible heat treatments, cold forming conditions, shapes and surface finishes that can make classification of these products difficult.</p><br/><br/><p>However, steels can be classified reasonably easily into a few major groups according to their chemical composition, applications, shapes and surface conditions.</p><br/><br/><p>Chemical composition - steels can be grouped into one of the three classes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>carbon steels</li><br/>  <li>low-alloy steels</li><br/>  <li>high-alloy steels</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>All steels contain a small amount of incidental elements (such as manganese, silicon, aluminium, phosphorus, sulphur and copper) left over from the steel-making process.

These can be agglomerated, used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as deoxidants, desulphurising agents or other similar usage. They’re generally not malleable and must contain by weight at least 4% of the element iron and one or more of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>manganese</li><br/>  <li>phosphorus</li><br/>  <li>silicon</li><br/>  <li>chromium</li><br/>  <li>carbon</li><br/>  <li>copper</li><br/>  <li>nickel</li><br/>  <li>aluminium</li><br/>  <li>boron</li><br/>  <li>cobalt</li><br/>  <li>molybdenum</li><br/>  <li>lead</li><br/>  <li>niobium</li><br/>  <li>titanium</li><br/>  <li>tungsten (wolfram)</li><br/>  <li>vanadium</li><br/>  <li>zirconium</li><br/>  <li>other elements</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>It’s also important to note that a ferro-alloy can only be considered as a binary and classified under a specific relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the elements listed above exceeds the minimum percentage listed. Otherwise it must be classified as a ternary or quaternary alloy as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, for a ferro-alloy to be correctly classified as ferro-silico-manganese, it must have more than 30% manganese and more than 8% silicon. If it has 7% silicon it is viewed as a binary ferro-alloy and must be classified as ferro-manganese in this example.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

Since then millions of gift-aiders and thousands of charities have benefitted. Last year alone Gift Aid was worth nearly £1.2 billion to UK charity sector. In total over £13 billion of Gift Aid relief has been paid to charities since 1990.</p><br/><br/><p>Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Damian Hinds said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>I’m delighted that we have now seen a quarter of a century of Gift Aid. In that time the scheme has helped people across the UK see their gift go that bit further.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">We will continue to improve the scheme whilst encouraging more charities and people to make the most of it to maximise the Gift Aid claimed on eligible donations.</p><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The government is continuing to work on refining the Gift Aid scheme to make it simpler for charities to claim on eligible donations. In 2013, government introduced an online system for charities to submit Gift Aid applications online, reducing the time taken to process Gift Aid payments to charities from around 15 working days to less than five days.</p><br/><br/><p>The government has also worked with the sector to develop a new, simpler, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467898/Charity_GAD_Single_Donation.pdf"">Gift Aid form</a> which will be introduced in April 2016, to make it easier for eligible donors to sign up to Gift Aid their donations.</p><br/><br/><p>Support for the sector extends beyond Gift Aid. For example, from April 2016 the government will increase the limit on the amount of money a charity can claim through the Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme each year, from £5,000 to £8,000. This means charities can receive a ‘top up’ on small donations like the money you give to a collection tin.</p><br/><br/><p>So how can you sign up for Gift Aid?</p><br/><br/><p>As an individual – you must have paid enough tax to cover the Gift Aid claimed on your donation. You can then complete a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-gift-aid-declaration-form-for-a-single-donation"">Gift Aid declaration form</a> alongside your donation.</p><br/><br/><p>As a charity - you need to register for charitable status with HMRC. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/claim-gift-aid"">GOV.UK</a> demonstrates the process.</p><br/></div></p>",

True tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco) are classified in chapter 24 of the UK Trade Tariff (Tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes). Tobacco related products, for example, tobacco oil, smoking replacement treatments may be classified elsewhere in the tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>You can get tobacco supplied in a variety of different ways:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>in a raw, unprocessed or unmanufactured state</li><br/>  <li>as manufactured cigars, cigarettes or cigarillos</li><br/>  <li>as prepared loose smoking tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as prepared chewing tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as snuff</li><br/>  <li>as prepared to be heated</li><br/>  <li>as homogenised or reconstituted tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as an extract or essence</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There are a range of manufactured tobacco and smoking substitutes. Some of these are classified as tobacco even though they do not contain any tobacco. This guide will explain where you should classify each of the products.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""raw-and-unprocessed-tobacco"">Raw and unprocessed tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>You can classify all forms of unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco refuse under heading 2401 - unmanufactured tobacco, tobacco refuse.</p><br/><br/><p>The term ‘unmanufactured tobacco’ includes many forms. It could be tobacco supplied as whole plants or leaves in the natural state, or as cured or fermented leaves.</p><br/><br/><p>It also includes tobacco which has been:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>stemmed or stripped</li><br/>  <li>trimmed or untrimmed</li><br/>  <li>broken or cut, including pieces cut to shape</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Tobacco leaves which have been blended, stemmed or stripped and ‘cased’ (‘sauced’ or ‘liquored’) with a liquid of appropriate composition to prevent, mould, drying and to preserve the flavour, are also covered in this heading. It does not include tobacco which is ready for smoking.</p><br/><br/><p>Unprocessed tobacco that is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>already prepared for retail distribution</li><br/>  <li>split from a bulk consignment into smaller quantities</li><br/>  <li>going to be processed into smokeable state at home (for example in a domestic blender or shredder)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This is considered smokeable without further industrial processing.</p><br/><br/><p>If the product meets this specification you can classify it to commodity code 2403191000 (tobacco, other manufactured, smoking tobacco, other, in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 500 grams).</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco refuse includes all waste resulting from:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the manipulation of tobacco leaves</li><br/>  <li>the manufacture of tobacco products</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This includes, for example, stalks, stems, midribs, trimmings, dust.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""cigars-cheroots-cigarillos-and-cigarettes-of-tobacco-or-of-tobacco-substitutes"">Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes</h2><br/><br/><p>Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes that are made of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tobacco</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of tobacco</li><br/>  <li>tobacco substitutes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These are classifiable under heading 2402 regardless of the proportions of tobacco present in the mixture.  For example, ‘cigarettes’ made from specially processed leaves of a variety of lettuce and contain neither tobacco nor nicotine would also classifiable under this heading.</p><br/><br/><p>Loose tobacco including pipe tobacco and tobacco for hand rolling cigarettes are classifiable under heading 2403. <a href=""#loose-hand-rolling-and-pipe-tobacco"">Find out about hand-rolling and pipe tobacco</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading does not cover medicinal cigarettes. Cigarettes containing certain types of products formulated to discourage the habit of smoking but which do not have medicinal properties remain classified in this heading.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""loose-hand-rolling-and-pipe-tobacco"">Loose hand-rolling and pipe tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>Smoking tobacco includes loose hand-rolling and pipe tobacco - whether or not it contains tobacco substitutes in any proportion - for use with a hookah or water pipe, all of these are classifiable under 2403 10. It also includes products which do not contain any tobacco at all.</p><br/><br/><p>Smoking tobacco is tobacco which has been cut or otherwise split, twisted or pressed into blocks which can be smoked without further industrial processing.</p><br/><br/><p>A hookah or water pipe uses a small charcoal tablet to gently heat a special, flavour-infused tobacco blend. The tobacco never burns, but is filtered as it’s drawn through water in the glass base before it’s inhaled through the hoses.</p><br/><br/><p>Depending on locality, hookahs are known by other names:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>shisha or sheesha</li><br/>  <li>hubble bubble</li><br/>  <li>nargeela - also known as nargile, narghile, nargileh or narguile</li><br/>  <li>argeela - also as arghileh or arguile</li><br/>  <li>boury</li><br/>  <li>gouza</li><br/>  <li>okka</li><br/>  <li>kalyan</li><br/>  <li>gewat suckre</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This style of pipe can be used for smoking many substances, including herbal fruits and tobacco. An example is shisha tobacco, which can also be known as tabac, tombak, tumbak, gouza, guza, moassel or sheesha. Shisha is a mixture of tobacco, molasses or sugar that is flavoured with fruit, glycerol, aromatic oils and extracts for example Meassel or Massel. The name is also used for products not containing molasses or sugar, for example Tumbak or Ajmani.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain tobacco are covered by subheading 240311. Tobacco-free products for water pipes, for example, Jurak - are classified under subheading 240399.</p><br/><br/><p>Cartridges and refills intended to be used in water pipe (Hookah) as a fog fluid containing aromatic flavourings are classified under subheading 38249992 if in liquid and 38249993 if other.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""homogenised-or-reconstituted-tobacco-and-tobacco-extracts-and-essences"">‘Homogenised’ or ‘reconstituted’ tobacco and tobacco extracts and essences</h2><br/><br/><p>‘Homogenised’ or ‘reconstituted’ tobacco includes products made of reformed tobacco made from tobacco leaves, tobacco refuse or dust. It’s sometimes supplied on a backing, for example, a sheet of cellulose from tobacco stems, and is generally put up in the form of rectangular sheets, also known as blunts, or strip. It can either be used as a wrapper in sheet form or shredded or chopped as a filler. All homogenised and reconstituted tobacco products are classified under 2403 91 00.</p><br/><br/><p>Manufactured tobacco substitutes include smoking mixtures which do not contain any tobacco. These may have a basis of herbs or another plants.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco extracts and essences are liquids which are extracted from moist tobacco leaves by either pressure, or prepared by boiling waste tobacco in water. They’re used for the manufacture of insecticides or parasiticides.</p><br/><br/><p>Manufactured tobacco substitutes and tobacco extracts and essences are classified under 2403 99 90.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco seed oil is not classified as a tobacco product and should be classified under heading 1515 - other fixed vegetable fats and oils.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""chewing-tobacco"">Chewing tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>Chewing tobacco is usually a highly fermented and liquored form of tobacco which is designed to be chewed, not smoked. It’s supplied in long strands of whole or very coarsely shredded leaves, or in the form of rolls, sticks, strips, cubes and blocks. It’s consumed by placing a part of the tobacco between the cheek and gum or the teeth and is then chewed. It’s classified under heading code 2403 99 10.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as western styles of chewing tobacco, there are many ethnic varieties of chewing tobacco but all styles are classifiable to 2403 99 10.</p><br/><br/><p>Paan masala is a filling often used in a type of Indian snack called Paan. This is where a betal leaf is used as a wrapping and the whole product is chewed as a palate cleanser and breath freshener. It is usually taken after meals and during leisure hours.</p><br/><br/><p>The ingredients of Paan Masalas vary with some containing tobacco whilst others are tobacco free. Classification of the products depends on what the product is made of and the intention of the product. For example a betel leaf filled with a mixture of coarsely ground or chopped betel nuts and other spices (paan supari) would be classifiable under heading 2008 as a preparation of nuts. If the paan contains tobacco (tambaku paan) in any proportion it should be classified under heading 2403.</p><br/><br/><p>Gutka is a preparation of crushed betel nuts, (supari) tobacco, catechu, lime, elachi (cardamoms), perfumed and permitted spices and flavours, and is consumed like chewing tobacco. This should be classified in the same way as paan under heading 2403.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""snuff"">Snuff</h2><br/><br/><p>Snuff, and tobacco which is compressed or liquored for the purpose of making snuff, is classified under heading 2403 99 10. Snuff is tobacco in powder or grain form which has been treated so that it can be taken as snuff and not smoked. There are 2 types of snuff, nasal snuff and oral snuff, also known as snus.</p><br/><br/><p>Nasal snuff is a dry to semi moist finely ground tobacco product which is mainly used in the nasal cavity. Nasal snuff exists in different flavour varieties.</p><br/><br/><p>Snus is a moist to semi moist, ground, oral tobacco product, which is used between the gum and the upper lip in the oral cavity. Snus exists in 2 packaging formats, loose and portion packed. Both forms exist in different flavour varieties. Unlike chewing tobacco oral snuff sachets are placed in the mouth between the gum and the lip, the user then sucks on the product and the nicotine soaks through the thin layer of skin into the bloodstream.</p><br/><br/><p>Note that Pakistani Neswar is also classified as snuff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""tobacco-for-heating-products"">Tobacco for heating products</h2><br/><br/><p>Tobacco for heating is a recent innovation in the tobacco market. It is used in devices that operate in a variety of ways, but they all contain processed tobacco that is heated, not burned as it is in conventional tobacco products, to produce or flavour vapour. In such devices, the tobacco is delivered in a manner which means it cannot be smoked. They are distinct from e-cigarettes, which do not contain tobacco.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco for heating is processed tobacco which has been treated and is delivered so that it cannot be smoked. In general a small amount is contained in a capsule which is inserted into a hand-held device. The device heats the tobacco to release flavours and nicotine but without combustion of the tobacco.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""nicotine-replacements-and-addiction-relief"">Nicotine replacements and addiction relief</h2><br/><br/><p>There are a number of different relief products and alternatives to cigarettes on the market including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>patches</li><br/>  <li>chewing gum</li><br/>  <li>electronic cigarettes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There’s no one classification for all these items but they’re instead classified based on their own characteristics.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine replacement (preparation, tablets, chewing gum) is classified under commodity code 2106 90 92 60 as a miscellaneous edible preparation. This is in line with EU Regulation 3565/88.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine based hand gel, is a gel rubbed into the hands so the nicotine is absorbed through the skin to weaken the craving for a cigarette. This is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes for situations in which one cannot smoke. The gels are classified as tobacco products under 38249993.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine patches (transdermal systems) intended to help smokers to stop smoking are classified to heading 38249958.</p><br/><br/><p>Electronic cigarette and nicotine inhalers, also known as an inhalator. If you have imported an electronic cigarette with a packet of cartridges, the whole set is to be classified together to commodity code 8543 70 90 99 as an electrical product not elsewhere specified. In line with EC Regulation 1143/2008.</p><br/><br/><p>A nicotine cartridge and refills containing a preparation of nicotine intended to assist smokers to stop smoking is classified to heading 38249956 and 38249957 if other.</p><br/><br/><p>Inhalators are classified according to the cartridges they’re supplied with and these are classified in the same way as cartridges for the electronic cigarette.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""excise-duty-on-tobacco-products"">Excise Duty on tobacco products</h2><br/><br/><p>Excise Duty is the most significant charge levied on the import of tobacco products.

For household and general lighting equipment, check heading code 9405 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff), where you can classify a piece of equipment according to its type, its intended use and the type of material from which it’s predominantly manufactured.</p><br/><br/><p>For lamps and lighting equipment designed for use in motor vehicles or self-powered portable lights, check heading codes 8512 and 8513 respectively.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying replacement bulbs, lamps and parts there are a number of very specific headings to consider. However, the vast majority of replacement bulbs and lamps are classified under heading code 8539, so provided you know which type of bulb or lamp you’re importing, you should be able to find the correct code.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide will help you to classify electric lamps correctly. In general terms, electric lamps are not complex to classify, provided you have an understanding of the type of lamp and its intended use.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll have to check different parts of the Tariff to find the correct classification as lamps for specific purposes are classified in the chapter of the Tariff most appropriate to their use. For example, toy lamps are classified in chapter 95 (toys), while battery-powered torches are classified in chapter 85 (machinery and mechanical appliances).</p><br/><br/><p>The more detailed information you have about the type of lamp or bulb, the easier it will be to classify it correctly. You need to know the type of lamp (such as halogen, tungsten, fluorescent) and the voltage.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""quick-reference-table-for-heading-codes"">Quick reference table for heading codes</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric ceiling or wall-lighting fittings, chandeliers, excluding those of a kind used for lighting public open spaces or thoroughfares</td><br/>      <td>9405 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric table, desk, bedside or floor-standing lamps</td><br/>      <td>9405 20</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Lighting sets of a kind used for Christmas trees</td><br/>      <td>9405 30</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Searchlights and spotlights</td><br/>      <td>9405 40 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Toy lamps or lighting figures</td><br/>      <td>9503</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Lighting or visual-signalling equipment used on bicycles</td><br/>      <td>8512 10 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Other lighting or visual signalling equipment</td><br/>      <td>8512 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Portable electric lamps designed to function by their own source of energy, for example, battery power torch</td><br/>      <td>8513 10 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric filament or discharge lamps, including sealed beam lamp units and ultra-violet or infra-red lamps, arc lamps; light-emitting diode (LED) lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Seal beam lamp units</td><br/>      <td>8539 10 00 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Seal beam lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 29 30 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Halogen lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 30 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Xenon lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 39 80 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Mains voltage halogen bulbs greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 92 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Low voltage halogen bulbs less than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 98 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Standard tungsten lamps greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 22 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tungsten reflector lamps greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 22 10 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Fluorescent tube - double ended cap type</td><br/>      <td>8539 3110 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Energy-saving lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 31 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Mercury vapour lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Sodium vapour lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Metal halide lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Neon lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 39 80 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ultra-violet lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 49 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Infra-red lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 49 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and bulbs</td><br/>      <td>8539 50 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LED strip comprising of Light Emitting Diodes, transistors, resistors and protection diodes, (EC Reg 708/2013)</td><br/>      <td>940540</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Photographic flashes</td><br/>      <td>9006 61 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>You will find lamps classified in the Tariff according to their predominant use.

Remember that if the defining characteristic of the good is its manufacture from plastic, such as a plastic bottle or a plastic hose, it will be classified in chapter 39 of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-polymers-in-primary-forms"">Classifying polymers in primary forms</h2><br/><br/><p>If you’re importing polymers in primary forms, it’s essential to know the chemical composition and what the predominant monomer is within the polymer.</p><br/><br/><p>The definition of ‘primary forms’ is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>liquids and pastes, including dispersions (ie emulsions and suspensions) and solutions</li><br/>  <li>blocks or irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Polymers are large molecules made from monomers, and their constituent parts are called monomeric units. A monomer is a molecule or compound, usually containing carbon, which is capable of conversion to polymers, synthetic resins or elastomers by combination with itself or other similar molecules or compounds.</p><br/><br/><p>There are many different polymers that exhibit different characteristics and properties and are used for different purposes. For example, polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>) is commonly used in the building industry for use in double glazing frames. Polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (<abbr title=""Polypropylene and polyethethylene terephthalate"">PET</abbr>) are commonly used in the manufacture of bottles.</p><br/><br/><p>To correctly classify your polymers in primary forms, you need to identify the predominant monomer:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>polymers of ethylene (heading 3901)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of propylene (heading 3902)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of styrene (heading 3903)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of vinyl chloride or other halogenated olefins (heading 3904)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of vinyl acetate or of other vinyl esters and other vinyl polymers (heading 3905)</li><br/>  <li>acrylic polymers (heading 3906)</li><br/>  <li>polyacetals, other polyethers and epoxide resins, polycarbonates, alkyd resins, polyallyl esters and other polyesters (heading 3907)</li><br/>  <li>polyamides (heading 3908)</li><br/>  <li>amino-resins, phenolic resins and polyurethanes (heading 3909)</li><br/>  <li>silicones (heading 3910)</li><br/>  <li>petroleum resins, coumarone-indene resins, polyterpenes, polysulphides, polysulphones (heading 3911)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Copolymers are produced by the simultaneous polymerisation of 2 or more dissimilar monomers. They contain more than one type or repeat of monomeric unit. For example, the copolymer ethylene-vinyl acetate  is created by polymerising ethylene and vinyl acetate.</p><br/><br/><p>In Tariff classification, the term ‘copolymer’ covers all polymers in which no single monomer contributes 95% or more by weight to the total polymer content.</p><br/><br/><p>However, they are produced, copolymers - including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers - are classified under the heading code covering the predominant comonomer. If no comonomer predominates, you should classify the goods in the heading code which is last in numerical order that is relevant to each of the comonomers.</p><br/><br/><p>Chemically modified polymers, where only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are classified under the heading code for the unmodified polymer.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-processed-or-finished-products"">Classifying processed or finished products</h2><br/><br/><p>When classifying processed or finished plastic products, it’s helpful to know as much about them as possible, including the:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>function or role of the goods</li><br/>  <li>polymer that they are made from</li><br/>  <li>method of manufacture</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The function or role of the goods is essential to classifying them correctly. The composition and method of manufacture may also be required to classify the goods correctly, although this is not always the case. However, it’s a very good idea to have all this information to hand as it will speed the classification process for you.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""manufacturing-techniques"">Manufacturing techniques</h3><br/><br/><p>Polymers in primary forms are processed using 3 different processes to create finished products:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>injection moulding is used to form plastics into hollow shapes - for example, bottles and containers, toys or petrol tanks</li><br/>  <li>compression moulding is used to form specific shapes using a mould - for example, knobs and handles for saucepans, irons or cookers or electrical fittings such as plugs, sockets and lamp fittings</li><br/>  <li>extrusion creates shapes by forcing material through a metal forming die - for example, film, sheet, rods, profile shapes, tubes or pipes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""classifying-specific-types-of-finished-or-processed-goods"">Classifying specific types of finished or processed goods</h3><br/><br/><p>If waste, parings and scrap (heading code 3915) have been transformed into a primary form, they should be classified as such, using the appropriate heading code between 3901 and 3914.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying tubes, pipes and hoses (heading code 3917), you should bear in mind that the definition covers all hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished, that are of a kind generally used for moving gases or liquids, such as ribbed garden hoses, perforated tubes or lay-flat tubing. However, if the goods have an internal cross-section that is not round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a  regular polygon, they’re not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.</p><br/><br/><p>To classify wall or ceiling coverings made of plastic (heading code 3918), they must be in rolls, of a width not less than 45 centimetres, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated. This is to differentiate them from some wallpapers.</p><br/><br/><p>There are very specific products covered under builders’ ware of plastic (heading code 3925).</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres</li><br/>  <li>structural elements used in floors, walls or partitions, and ceilings or roofs</li><br/>  <li>gutters and gutter fittings</li><br/>  <li>doors, windows and their frames, and thresholds for doors</li><br/>  <li>balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers</li><br/>  <li>shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof</li><br/>  <li>large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example in shops, workshops and warehouses</li><br/>  <li>ornamental architectural features, for example flutings, cupolas and dovecotes</li><br/>  <li>fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings - for example knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>In some cases, textiles may be added to plastic products to provide reinforcement. If the plastic is cellular and has been covered on one face only with the textile fabric, you should classify it under the appropriate heading code in chapter 39. If the plastic is covered on both faces, the goods should be classified as a textile, using the appropriate heading code in chapter 59.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""common-abbreviations-for-plastics-and-polymers"">Common abbreviations for plastics and polymers</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Abbreviation</th><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>ABS</td><br/>      <td>Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>BDS</td><br/>      <td>Butadiene-styrene block copolymer</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CA</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose acetate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CB</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose butyrate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CE</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose/cellophane</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>EVA</td><br/>      <td>Ethylene-vinyl acetate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>GPPS</td><br/>      <td>General-purpose polystyrene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>GRP</td><br/>      <td>Glass-reinforced plastic</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>HDPE</td><br/>      <td>High-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>HIPS</td><br/>      <td>High-impact polystyrene (toughened polystyrene)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LDPE</td><br/>      <td>Low-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LLDPE</td><br/>      <td>Linear Low-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>MF</td><br/>      <td>Melamine formaldehyde</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>OPP</td><br/>      <td>Orientated polypropylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA</td><br/>      <td>Polyamide (nylon)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 4 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 4 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6 10</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 11</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 11</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 12</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 12</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PBT</td><br/>      <td>Polybutylene terephthalate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PC</td><br/>      <td>Polycarbonate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PE</td><br/>      <td>Polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td><abbr title=""Polypropylene and polyethethylene terephthalate"">PET</abbr></td><br/>      <td>Polyethylene terephthalate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-39"">What’s not covered in chapter 39</h2><br/><br/><p>Goods are only classified under their constituent materials when they are not specifically referred to elsewhere in the Tariff. There is a multitude of goods made from plastics that are specifically covered elsewhere in the Tariff, for example:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>textiles and textile articles are covered in Section XI - for example knitted or woven polyester or nylon articles</li><br/>  <li>footwear, headgear, umbrellas, walking sticks, whips or riding crops are covered in Section XII</li><br/>  <li>imitation jewellery</li><br/>  <li>machines and mechanical or electrical appliances, parts of aircraft or vehicles are covered in Section XVII</li><br/>  <li>optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments, clocks and watches, musical instruments and accessories are covered in Section XVIII</li><br/>  <li>furniture, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs or prefabricated buildings are covered in chapter 94</li><br/>  <li>toys, games and sports requisites are covered in chapter 95</li><br/>  <li>brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette holders, pens or propelling pencils are covered in chapter 96</li><br/>  <li>plastics that have been printed with motifs, text or pictures that define the goods (apart from floor, wall or ceiling coverings) are covered in chapter 49</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""finished-and-processed-products"">Finished and processed products</h3><br/><p>It’s useful to consider if the fact it is made from a plastic is its defining characteristic when you classify a product made from plastics.</p><br/><br/><p>As a general rule of thumb, if the defining characteristic is that a product is made of plastic, you will find it in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, a plastic bottle or floorcovering is classified under this chapter. However, spectacle frames which happen to be made of plastic are classified elsewhere, as the fact they are spectacle frames is the defining factor, not their construction from plastic.</p><br/><br/><p>Statuettes and other ornamental articles for the home and garden consisting of rock powder (for example calcium carbonate), plastic, and sometimes a small amount of other additives are classified within chapter 39 when the plastic gives the articles their essential character. The rock powder in this case acts as the filler material with the plastic supplying the defining characteristic for the product.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""general-interpretive-rules"">General Interpretive Rules</h3><br/><br/><p>In common with many commodities, the General Interpretive Rules apply to plastics.</p><br/><br/><p>Where goods are presented as sets that comprise 2 or more separate articles that may fall under different classification codes, they should be classified under the code that represents the primary function of the set.

Civil aircraft or parts for use in civil aircraft (where designated) are subject to end use control. The description ‘civil aircraft’ is defined as aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the EU member states which carry a military or non-civil registration. For all relevant nomenclature descriptions ‘civil aircraft’ is to be taken to include civil ground flying trainers.</p><br/><br/><p>The subheading 8802 11 00 covers multi-rotor helicopters (so-called ‘drones’ of an unladen weight not exceeding 2,000 kilograms) of different sizes which can operate autonomously (to a pre-programmed destination) or are remotely piloted by the user.</p><br/><br/><p>If they have the character of toys or recreational models, they are classified under heading 9503. See the Explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature to that heading.</p><br/><br/><p>Drones integrated with a camera must be considered under heading 852580.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide will help you classify aircraft parts and accessories using the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-are-considered-to-be-parts-of-aircraft-in-heading-8803"">What are considered to be ‘parts of aircraft’ in heading 8803</h2><br/><br/><p>Heading 8803 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom covers parts of the goods falling in heading 8801 or 8802, provided that those parts fulfil both of the following conditions:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>they must be identifiable as being suitable for use solely or principally with the goods of headings 8801 (balloons and dirigibles, gliders and hang gliders and other non-powered aircraft), or 8802 (other aircraft (helicopters aeroplanes), spacecraft (including satellites) and suborbital and spacecraft launch vehicles</li><br/>  <li>they must not be excluded by the provisions of the notes to section XVII of the Tariff</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""items-excluded-by-the-provisions-of-the-notes-to-section-xvii"">Items excluded by the provisions of the notes to section XVII</h3><br/><br/><p>The expressions ‘parts’ and ‘parts and accessories’ don ot apply to the following articles, whether they are identifiable as for the goods of this section:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>joints, washers and the like of any material (classified according to their constituent material or in heading 8484) or other articles of vulcanised rubber other than hard rubber (heading 4016)</li><br/>  <li>parts of general use, as defined in note 2 to section XV, of base metal (section XV), or similar goods of plastics (chapter 39)</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 82 (tools)</li><br/>  <li>articles of heading 8306</li><br/>  <li>machines or apparatus of headings 8401 to 8479, or parts of that, articles of heading 8481 or 8482 or, provided they constitute integral parts of engines or motors, articles of heading 8483</li><br/>  <li>electrical machinery or equipment (chapter 85)</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 90</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 91</li><br/>  <li>arms (chapter 93)</li><br/>  <li>lamps or lighting fittings of heading 9405</li><br/>  <li>brushes of a kind used as parts of vehicles (heading 9603)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>References in chapters 86 to 88 to ‘parts and accessories’ do not apply to parts and accessories which are not suitable for use solely or mainly with the articles of those chapters. A part or accessory which answers to a description in 2 or more of the headings of those chapters is classified under that heading which corresponds to the main use of that part or accessory.</p><br/><br/><p>There are other exclusions not mentioned in the above notes, where there are specific raised headings for the items, for example:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>700721 80 10 - laminated safety glass - windshields, not framed, for use in civil aircraft</li><br/>  <li>940110 00 - seats of a kind used for aircraft</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Where items are mentioned under their own raised heading, they are to be classified to their respective raised heading and not as parts under 8803.</p><br/><br/><p>The section and chapter notes should be used at all times when classifying any product.

If made of vulcanised rubber, they are classified in heading 4016, specifically in subheading 401693.</p><br/><br/><p>Items of hard rubber are classified in heading 4017. Gaskets and similar joints of metal sheeting, combined with other materials, are covered by heading 8484, specifically in subheading 848410. If made of a single layer of one metal, the goods will be classified as an article of that specific metal.</p><br/><br/><p>Electrical insulating materials such as heat shrink polyolefin tube with no electrical connections would be classified according to its material, rather than its use. Polyolefin is a plastic material and would be classified in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><p>Paints, adhesives, fillers and mastics are all classified to their respective headings.</p><br/><br/><p>Automatic data processing (<abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr>) machines are classified under heading 8471, see note 5(A) to chapter 84, and in particular note 5(A) (2). This heading is intended primarily to cover laptop and desktop PCs, which allow the user full interactivity for example, by word processing and spreadsheet applications.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr> machines that can only operate on fixed programmes, which cannot be modified by the user, (even if they can choose between several fixed programmes), are classified within their own specific raised headings, and not as a part of an <abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr> machine, see note 5(E) to chapter 84, ‘Machines incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data-processing machine and performing a specific function other than data processing are to be classified in the heading appropriate to their respective functions or, failing that, in residual headings.’ For example, navigational equipment is classified in heading 9014.</p><br/><br/><p>Radios for radio broadcasting reception only - heading 8527.

Parts of radios will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 85 (see note 2 to section XVI). </p><br/><br/><p>Radio navigation equipment including GPS systems (Global Positioning Satellite) - heading 8526. Parts of radio navigation equipment will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 85 (see note 2 to section XVI).</p><br/><br/><p>Other navigational instruments and appliances including Sonar - heading 9014. Parts and accessories of other navigational instruments and appliances will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 90 (see note 2 to chapter 90).</p><br/><br/><p>Weapons computers - chapter 93. Any computer that’s integral to, or specially designed for a particular weapon, would be classified in the appropriate parts heading. The complete weapon including the weapons computers would be classified in the appropriate heading within chapter 93. (Please note it is unlikely for weapons system computer to be classfied to 8471, being as these computers have a function other than data processing).</p><br/><br/><p>Measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines, including test sets will be classified within chapter 90.</p><br/><br/><p>Test benches generally consist of a frame with a measuring or calibrating instrument. They are used to test engines, motors, electrical generators, pumps, speed indicators, tachometers and so on - heading 9031. If the ‘test set’ is checking a specific parameter they may be classified elsewhere in an appropriate raised heading in chapter 90. For example, checking voltage 9030. </p><br/><br/><p>Flight simulators are classified in heading 8805. If the simulator is mounted on a motor vehicle, chassis or trailer, then it is classified within heading 8705 or 8716 depending on its specific features or capabilities,see explanatory notes. Parts and accessories of simulators will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 87 (see notes 2 and 3 to section XVII).</p><br/><br/><p>Printed circuit boards are classified according to what function they perform, or as a part of the machine they are designed for use with.</p><br/><br/><p>Carpets and other floor coverings, of textile or rubber, whether or not cut to shape, are to be classified in chapter 57 (textile) or chapter 40 (rubber).</p><br/><br/><p>Articles that are intended for replenishment of consumable supplies, or to be sold on board for example after shave, perfume and sun creams. are also excluded from classification in this section, and are to classified under their respective headings.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""end-use-relief-provisions-for-civil-aircraft-parts"">End-use relief provisions for civil aircraft parts</h2><br/><br/><p>Importers who wish to take advantage of the end-use relief provisions are required to be authorised by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>) before they import or receive goods affected by these provisions. </p><br/><br/><p>Relief from customs duty is provided for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>civil aircraft (aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the EU member states which carry a military or non-civil registration)</li><br/>  <li>certain goods for use in civil aircraft (including goods for use in ground flying-trainers for civil use) and for incorporation within in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification or conversion</li><br/>  <li>ground flying-trainers and their parts, for civil use</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Relief from customs duties is subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions with a view to customs control of the use of such goods, see Articles 291 to 300 of <a rel=""external"" href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:1993:253:TOC"">Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>An alternative to using end use relief is the certificate of airworthiness scheme.

They can be either uncooked, or cooked by steaming or boiling in water before being frozen. They may have sugar or other sweetening matters added. ‘Frozen’ means that the product has been cooled to below its freezing point until it is frozen throughout.</p><br/><br/><p>If a fruit product covered by chapter 8 is not frozen throughout then it cannot be classified under heading code 0811. Soft frozen or partially frozen fruit must be classified as chilled.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-dried-fruit-and-nuts"">Classifying dried fruit and nuts</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 8 includes dried fruit and nuts. Provided that they still keep the characteristics of dried fruit or dried nuts, these may be partially rehydrated or treated for one of the following purposes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>to preserve or stabilise the product - for example by moderate heat treatment, sulphuring or adding sorbic acid or potassium sorbate</li><br/>  <li>to improve or maintain the product’s appearance - for example by adding vegetable oil or small quantities of glucose syrup</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-frozen-tropical-fruit"">Classifying frozen tropical fruit</h2><br/><br/><p>Subheading codes 0811 90 11, 0811 90 31 and 0811 90 85 refer to tropical fruit.

For classification purposes the term ‘wood’ also includes bamboo and other woody materials.</p><br/><br/><p>There are some wood articles which chapter 44 does not cover, such as furniture, toys and other items that have been significantly worked. Items like these are covered in other chapters, according to their use.</p><br/><br/><p>Some articles (though not all) must meet specific size requirements to be classified under certain heading codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Specialist terms are often used to describe both woodworking processes and articles made of wood.

There’s no limit to the size that fuel wood can be, but it’s generally in the form of short pieces of logs, split logs or billets. Fuel wood may also be in the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>twigs</li><br/>  <li>faggots</li><br/>  <li>rough sticks</li><br/>  <li>vine stems</li><br/>  <li>tree stumps and roots</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Logs used for pulping or for manufacturing matchsticks are not classified as fuel wood. This is because, unlike fuel logs, they’re carefully graded, they may be bark peeled and they’re generally not broken, split, curved, knotty or forked. These logs are classified under heading code 4403.</p><br/><br/><p>Wood in chips or particles is classified under subheading codes 4401 21 and 4401 22. However, the following types of wood are not classified under these subheading codes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>chipwood that’s used for plaiting or making sieves, chip-boxes, pill-boxes and so on - this is classified under heading code 4404</li><br/>  <li>wood shavings that are used in vinegar manufacturing or for clarifying liquids - these are also classified under heading code 4404</li><br/>  <li>wood wool and wood flour - these are classified under heading code 4405</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Wood waste and scrap wood are classified under subheading code 4401 31. They consist of wood that’s not usable as timber and include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>saw mill or planing mill rejects</li><br/>  <li>manufacturing waste</li><br/>  <li>broken planks</li><br/>  <li>old crates</li><br/>  <li>bark and shavings</li><br/>  <li>waste and scrap joinery and carpentry</li><br/>  <li>spent dyewood and tanning wood bark</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Waste and scrap wood are used in particular in paper manufacturing, particle board and fibreboard manufacturing as well as for fuel. All waste and scrap wood that’s intended for use as fuel (regardless of whether it’s been formed into common fuel types like logs, briquettes or pellets) is always classified as waste wood under subheading 4401 31 and never as fuel wood.</p><br/><br/><p>Pulpwood in rounds or quarter split is not classed as waste or scrap wood. Instead it’s classified under heading code 4403.</p><br/><br/><p>Wood charcoal, which is obtained through carbonising wood out of contact with the air, is classified under heading code 4402. This heading code also includes charcoal obtained through carbonising coconut shells, other shells and nuts. Charcoal may be in the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>blocks</li><br/>  <li>sticks</li><br/>  <li>granules</li><br/>  <li>powder</li><br/>  <li>briquettes</li><br/>  <li>tablets</li><br/>  <li>balls</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Charcoal that’s agglomerated with tar is also classified under heading code 4402.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-rough-wood-and-roughly-squared-wood"">Classifying rough wood and roughly squared wood</h2><br/><br/><p>Rough wood is timber in its natural, felled state, usually with the branches chopped off.

Wood may be injected or impregnated to preserve it, to make it more durable, to make it fire resistant and to protect it from shrinking. The process may involve the wood being soaked in open vats of hot liquid for a long period and then left in the liquid until it cools. Alternatively the wood can be treated in an autoclave, in a vacuum or under pressure. Treatment products include creosote, dinitrophenols and dinitrocresols.</p><br/><br/><p>Poles made of coniferous wood are often treated in this way and, to be classified under subheading code 4403 11, they must be at least 6 metres long but no longer than 18 metres.

This makes them stronger and easier to fit, unlike the older style, square-edged planks or blocks.</p><br/><br/><p>Original hardwoods such as oak and elm are giving way to cheaper softwood alternatives like pine.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""glossary-of-wood-flooring-terms"">Glossary of wood flooring terms</h2><br/><br/><p>Some of the wood flooring terms used in this guide - and in the Tariff - are listed and explained below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>basket pattern - assembly of fingers, blocks or strips placed edge to edge, to make up a square, the side of which is the same length as the finger, block or strip</li><br/>  <li>brick pattern - parquet made up of pieces of equal length and width, where the end joint is at the centre of the juxtaposed element</li><br/>  <li>engineered wood - layers of hardwood compressed together, like solid wood - it can be sanded and renovated after laying</li><br/>  <li>French flooring - flooring made up of pieces that have a random length and a series of widths, arranged in a parallel direction</li><br/>  <li>herringbone - parquet made up of pieces of the same size, with the ends cut at a right angle, laid perpendicular to one another, at an angle of 45 degrees in relation to the direction of the walls or battens</li><br/>  <li>Hungarian pattern - parquet made up of pieces of the same size, with the ends cut at an angle of 45 and 60 degrees, that are laid end to end at a right angle or at an angle of 120 degrees, forming parallel patterns</li><br/>  <li>laminated - laminated wood should not be confused with laminated plastic or paper - some modern laminated flooring uses a photographic representation of wood on plastic or paper that’s applied to high density fibreboard or a similar product - this type of laminate does not age and usually cannot be sanded and renovated like solid wood</li><br/>  <li>multi-layer flooring - wood flooring with a top layer thickness of at least 2.5 millimetres before installation</li><br/>  <li>parquet - wood flooring with a top layer thickness of at least 2.5 millimetres before installation</li><br/>  <li>parquet panel - pre-assembled laying unit made up from parquet pieces</li><br/>  <li>planking - this is available in various widths, either with tongue and groove in lengths or as plain square-edged planks that simply butt up against one another</li><br/>  <li>solid wood block parquet - uniform brick-like blocks - usually oak - laid in a herringbone, brick, ladder or basket formation</li><br/>  <li>solid wood parquet - made up of different coloured hardwood sections to create decorative patterning - this type of floor is usually allowed to acclimatise to the building where it’s to be laid as the timber’s moisture content can vary,  this causes expansion and contraction so the wood needs time to stabilise</li><br/>  <li>strip pattern - parquet made up of an assembly of equal width but random length strips</li><br/>  <li>veneer - a single thin or fine layer of wood that has been glued to a manufactured base - veneer floors are generally fitted ‘floating’, which means they’re not fixed to a sub-floor, they lie on a foam or cork underlay and must have a flat, even surface beneath them</li><br/>  <li>wood block - floors made up from small strips or blocks of wood, around three inches wide and nine inches long, arranged in herringbone, basket-weave and other geometric patterns</li><br/>  <li>wood laminate - has thin layers of wood that are glued to a manufactured base</li><br/>  <li>wood planks - come in long lengths with widths of 4 inches (or 10 centimetres) or more</li><br/>  <li>wood strip - boards are narrower and shorter than planks and have up to 3 strips of wood per board</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-44"">What’s not covered in chapter 44</h2><br/><br/><p>The following items are not covered in chapter 44:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>wood in chips and similar forms, used mainly in perfumes and pharmaceutical products or in insecticides and fungicides -

Long grains of brown rice tend to be less fluffy and tender, and short grains less sticky.  Brown rice also takes about twice as long to cook and has a much shorter shelf life (because of the oil in the germ). </p><br/><br/><p>Examples of rice falling within this definition are those with the commercial descriptions ‘brown rice’, ‘cargo rice’, ‘loonzain’ and ‘riso sabamato’. Husked brown rice (cargo rice) which although the husk has been removed by mechanical hullers, is still enclosed in the pericarp. Husked rice almost always still contains a small quantity of paddy.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""semi-milled-or-wholly-milled-rice-whether-or-not-polished-or-glazed"">1006 30 - Semi-milled or wholly milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed</h3><br/><br/><p>Rice can also be milled to remove the pericarp (the outer layer of the rice which is still present in brown rice). Rice of this sort has either been semi-milled or wholly milled (also referred to as bleached rice).</p><br/><br/><p>Semi-milled rice consists of rice from which the husk, part of the germ and the whole or part of the outer layers of the pericarp, but not the inner layers, have been removed.</p><br/><br/><p>Wholly milled rice consists of whole rice from which the pericarp has been completely removed by passage through special tapering cylinders. Wholly milled rice can also be polished and subsequently glazed in order to improve its appearance. The polishing process (which is designed to embellish the mat surface of the plain milled rice is carried out in brush machines or ‘polishing cones’. Glazing consists of coating the grains with a mixture of glucose and talcum in special glazing drums. The heading also includes ‘Camolino’ rice, which consists of milled rice coated with a film of oil.</p><br/><br/><p>Rice can also be referred to as parboiled. This means that the grains of rice, whilst still in the husk and before any other process has been carried out (eg husking, milling, etc), has been soaked in hot water or steamed and then dried. The grain structure of parboiled rice is only modified to a minor extent by the process it has undergone and is not classed as cooked rice. Such rice, after milling, polishing, etc, takes from 20 to 35 minutes to cook fully. Parboiled rice is usually puffed in appearance.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""broken-rice"">1006 40 - Broken rice</h3><br/><br/><p>Broken rice is damaged white rice, broken during processing. During the milling process grain fragments, the length of which does not exceed three quarters of the average length of the whole grain, are separated from the white rice, whose shape remains intact. This is classed as broken rice. A grain of broken rice gives a low fibre texture and low nutrient level, while retaining its high energy. Broken rice contains more grain fragments within the grain. This type of rice is of a lower quality and is usually used for baby formulas, rice cereals, pet foods, rice wine and rice flour, as well as pre-package or canned goods.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""exclusions-from-1006"">Exclusions from 1006</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading 1006 only includes rice in an uncooked and unprocessed state. This means that products from the milling of rice are excluded and are classified in chapter 11.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading 1006 also excludes rice which has been submitted to a treatment which has considerably modified the grain structure. Pre-cooked rice consisting of worked grains which have been either fully or partially cooked and then dehydrated fall in heading 1904. Partially pre-cooked rice takes 5 to 12 minutes to prepare for consumption, whereas fully pre-cooked rice needs only to be soaked in water and brought to the boil before consumption. ‘Puffed’ rice obtained by the swelling process and ready for consumption is also classified in heading 1904.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-the-size-of-the-grain-of-rice"">Classifying the size of the grain of rice</h2><br/><br/><p>Rice is generally classified according to the size of the grain. The length to width ratio of the grain size is also taken into account. To calculate this, divide the average length of the grain by the average width. Alternatively, arrange four pieces of rice. If the piece along the top is shorter than the other three then the length/width ration equals less than three, if it is the same length or longer then the length/width ration will be equal or greater than three.</p><br/><br/><p>Short grain rice (also referred to as round) is almost round, with moist grains that stick together when cooked and is generally used for making rice puddings and the like. This type of rice has grains which are of a length not exceeding 5.2mm and of a length/width ratio of less than 2. Short grain rice has a short, plump, almost round kernel.</p><br/><br/><p>Medium grain rice is shorter and plumper and works well in dishes such as Paella and Risotto. This type of rice has grains of which are of a length exceeding 5.2mm but not exceeding 6.0mm and of a length/width ratio of less than 3.</p><br/><br/><p>Long grain rice is long and slender, the grains stay separate after cooking. This type of rice, the grains of which are of a length exceeding 6.0mm.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-cooked-rice"">Classifying cooked rice</h2><br/><br/><p>Cooked rice dishes are classified under heading 1904. The following are some examples of products included.</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (72%), chicken meat (20%), a mixture of spices (7%), lemon grass (0.5%) and anchovy extract (0.5%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (65%), chicken meat (14%), a mixture of spices (13.2%), aubergines (3%), basil (2.5%) and anchovy extract (2.3%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (65.4%), chicken meat (15.5%), potatoes (10%), a mixture of spices (7.1%) and anchovy extract (2%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (50%), beef (20%), potatoes (15%), a mixture of spices (7%), groundnuts (3%), anchovy extract (3%) and onions (2%).</p><br/><br/><p>Microwaveable instant fried rice, with green curry and meat. Ingredients include instant rice, meat (16%), seasoning pack.</p><br/><br/><p>If a ready-made rice-based meal contains more than 20% of any kind of meat, fish, crustacean or mollusc (calculated as a percentage of the whole dish) it should be classified as a preparation of that meat or fish in chapter 16.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""types-varieties-and-forms-of-rice"">Types, varieties and forms of rice</h2><br/><br/><p>There are many varieties of rice now available, ranging from the familiar white or brown long-grain rice to speciality ones such as basmati and the so-called glutinous rice used in Japanese cooking to make sushi. Rice is also marketed in a variety of convenience packs. Some of these are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""della-delrose-and-delmont"">Della, Delrose, and Delmont</h3><br/><p>These varieties combine the qualities of regular long grain rice and basmati rice. They have an aroma similar to basmati. However, cooked grains swell in both length and width, like regular long grain rice.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""black-japonica"">Black Japonica</h3><br/><p>This is an aromatic rice with a dark black bran. Like brown rice, it is minimally processed to retain its bran layers and takes 45 to 50 minutes to prepare. Cooked grains are slightly chewy with a subtle sweet spiciness.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""brown-long-grain-rice"">Brown long-grain rice</h3><br/><p>This rice retains the natural bran layer which is rich in many vitamins and minerals, including rice bran oil. This long-grain rice is firm in texture, with a slightly nutty flavour.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""white-long-grain-rice"">White long-grain rice</h3><br/><p>Long-grain rice is the separating grain which is delicious in the many international dishes of Asia, India and Spain.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""white-medium-grain-rice"">White medium-grain rice</h3><br/><p>Better known as Risotto or Arborio rice, this is the softer cooking medium-grain rice which has the advantage of being able to carry flavours and colours well. Its soft, creamy texture makes it ideal for desserts such as creamy rice pudding. It absorbs as much as five times its weight in liquid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""arborio-rice"">Arborio rice</h3><br/><p>A type of short-grain rice traditionally grown in Italy and used to make risotto. The high starch content of Arborio rice gives risotto its characteristic creamy texture.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""easy-cook-long-grain-white-or-brown-rice"">Easy cook long-grain white or brown rice</h3><br/><p>Sometimes called parboiled or pre-fluffed rice. It is steamed under pressure before milling which hardens the grain, reducing the possibility of over-cooking. This process also helps to retain much of the natural vitamin and mineral content.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""jasmine-or-thai-fragrant-rice"">Jasmine or Thai fragrant rice</h3><br/><p>This long-grain white rice has a delicate Jasmine fragrance which makes it perfect for inclusion in Asian dishes and with curries and seafood. A long-grain variety popular in Thailand and appreciated for its sweet aroma and nutty flavour. It’s used as a cheap substitute for Basmati rice.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""kalijira-rice"">Kalijira rice</h3><br/><p>This tiny aromatic rice is grown in Bangladesh, cooks fast and is especially used in rice puddings.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""basmati"">Basmati</h3><br/><p>A variety of long grain rice. It is an aromatic, fragrant and slender, and is a non-glutinous rice. When cooked it swells only lengthwise, resulting in long slender grains that are very dry, light and separate not sticky. Pakistan and India are the largest cultivators and exporters of rice; it is primarily grown through paddy field farming in the Punjab region. The grains of Basmati are longer than most other types of rice. Cooked grains of Basmati rice are characteristically free flowing rather than sticky. As with most long grain rice, cooked Basmati rice can be uniquely identified by its fragrance. Basmati rice is available as either white or brown. The approved varieties of Basmati rice are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Basmati 370</li><br/>  <li>Basmati 386 (India)</li><br/>  <li>Type-3 (Dehradun India)</li><br/>  <li>Taraori Basmati (HBC-19 India)</li><br/>  <li>Basmati 217 (India)</li><br/>  <li>Ranbir Basmati (India)</li><br/>  <li>Kernel (Basmati Pakistan)</li><br/>  <li>Pusa Basmati</li><br/>  <li>Super Basmati</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""wild-rice"">Wild rice</h3><br/><br/><p>A tall aquatic grass of North America with a grain which is two or more times the length of the long grain rice varieties of Asia (Oryza). The name wild rice is misleading because it actually the seed of a type of wild grass (zinania aquatica) which grows in the shallow lake area of North America. Its long slender seeds are dark brown which turn purple when cooked. Despite of its name it is not related to domesticated rice (oryza).</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

adults or children, are under subheadings of heading code 9503. Toys intended for animals, including pets, are classified in their own appropriate heading.</p><br/><br/><p>The classification listings are quite detailed to cover the majority of specific commodities.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tricycles-scooters-pedal-cars-and-similar-toys"">Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar toys</h3><br/><br/><p>In classification terms, these are restricted to wheeled toys designed to be driven by children and powered or propelled by the children themselves using pedals, hand levers or motors.</p><br/><br/><p>The key heading code for these items is 9503 00 10 and includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>childrens tricycles and similar items, but bear in mind bicycles for children are classified as bicycles, using heading code 8712</li><br/>  <li>scooters designed to be ridden by children</li><br/>  <li>pedal or hand-propelled wheeled toys in the form of animals</li><br/>  <li>pedal cars or motorised cars, often in the form of miniature sports cars, jeeps or lorries</li><br/>  <li>wheeled toys propelled by hand levers</li><br/>  <li>other wheeled toys drawn or pushed and large enough for children to ride in</li><br/>  <li>childrens cars powered by a motor</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Practical devices for children to sit in, such as baby walkers, are not classed as toys - a different chapter using heading code 9403 covers these.</p><br/><br/><p>Other items excepted include those without wheels, such as rocking horses, which we classify under heading code 9503 00 41. They’re usually stuffed and represent animals.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""dolls-representing-humans-their-parts-and-accessories"">Dolls representing humans, their parts and accessories</h3><br/><br/><p>Dolls are generally covered by 2 heading codes. Dolls themselves under 9503 00 21, and their parts and accessories under 9503 00 29.</p><br/><br/><p>These heading codes cover dolls used as toys by adults or children. It includes dolls used for decorative purposes, such as mascot dolls or boudoir dolls.</p><br/><br/><p>A plastic doll with movable limbs filled with sweets would come under subheading 9503 00 21, as in EC Regulation 41/2013. Remember that dolls only representing humans are covered by these classification codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Dolls representing non-human figures, for example, robots, devils or angels, are classified under heading codes 9503 00 41 or 9503 00 49. Read the information on general toys below for more details.</p><br/><br/><p>Parts and accessories covered by 9503 00 29 include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>heads</li><br/>  <li>bodies</li><br/>  <li>limbs</li><br/>  <li>eyes (other than those unmounted on the dolls and made of glass, which are classified under heading code 7018)</li><br/>  <li>moving mechanisms for eyes</li><br/>  <li>voice-producing mechanisms</li><br/>  <li>wigs</li><br/>  <li>dolls’ clothing, shoes and hats</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There are some specific commodities that are covered by different heading codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Musical boxes with a doll attached are classified under heading code 9208.</p><br/><br/><p>Tin soldiers without moving parts or removable clothing are classified under heading code 9503 00 85. This is because they’re die-cast models made of metal, rather than dolls.</p><br/><br/><p>Larger figures used for shop window displays have their own heading code of 9618.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""general-toys"">General toys</h3><br/><br/><p>Train sets and scale model assembly kits are classified under heading code 9503 00 30. This includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>trains</li><br/>  <li>tracks</li><br/>  <li>signals</li><br/>  <li>planes</li><br/>  <li>boats</li><br/>  <li>vehicles</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Construction kits, such as building blocks of plastic, are covered by heading code 9503 00 35.</p><br/><br/><p>The key point of difference for these 2 classifications is that if the toy kit is designed to be permanently assembled, such as a model car or aeroplane kit, it’ll be classified in the former heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s designed to be constructed and deconstructed, like plastic building blocks, it’ll be classified under the latter category.</p><br/><br/><p>Toys and other play items representing non-human figures are covered by heading codes 9503 00 41 if they’re stuffed, and 9503 00 49 if they’re not stuffed.</p><br/><br/><p>Toy musical instruments are classified under heading code 9503 00 55. These are distinguished from ‘full’ musical instruments by having limited capabilities - for example, an inability to produce the range of notes of its adult counterpart. Electrically operated instruments, such as organs, are also classified here.</p><br/><br/><p>Toy musical apparatus, such as childrens record players or CD players that play rigid plastic discs rather than standard records or CDs, are also covered in this heading code, as are toy musical boxes and other items that have a wind-up mechanism and play a limited range of tunes.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading codes 9503 00 61 and 9503 00 69 cover puzzles of all types, including jigsaws, sliders or Rubik’s cubes.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-toys-put-up-in-sets-or-outfits-under-subheading-9503-00-70"">Other toys put up in sets or outfits under subheading 9503 00 70</h3><br/><br/><p>‘Sets’ of this subheading consist of 2 or more different types of articles (mainly for amusement), put up in the same packing for retail sale without repacking.</p><br/><br/><p>Articles of the same subheading, except for items covered by subheadings 9503 00 95 or 9503 00 99 (as these subheadings may include miscellaneous articles of different types), are not to be considered different types of articles.</p><br/><br/><p>Apart from the articles forming a set, simple accessories or objects of minor importance intended to be used with the articles (for example, a plastic carrot or a plastic brush for a toy animal) can be present.</p><br/><br/><p>By virtue of Note 4 to Chapter 95, this subheading includes sets intended for the amusement of children, consisting of articles of heading 9503 combined with one or more items which, if presented separately, would be classified in other headings, provided that the combinations have the essential character of toys.</p><br/><br/><p>Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>sets consisting of toys in the form of injection moulds and moulds for modelling pastes together with other items such as tubes or tablets of paint, modelling pastes, pencils and chalks</li><br/>  <li>cosmetic sets for children containing articles of heading 9503 combined with preparations of heading 3304</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, cosmetic sets for children containing preparations of heading 3304 which do not contain any articles of heading 9503 are not included (heading 3304).</p><br/><br/><p>‘Outfits’ of this subheading consist of 2 or more different articles put up in the same packing for retail sale, without repacking, and are specific to a particular type of recreation, work, person or profession, such as instructional and educational toys.</p><br/><br/><p>Outfits would not include textile items of fancy dress. These would be classified according to the material from which they’re made - see Section XI (Chapter 61 or Chapter 62).</p><br/><br/><p>Toy weapons, such as guns, rifles, swords and water pistols are under heading code 9503 00 81.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading codes 9503 00 85, 9503 00 95 and 9503 00 99 cover a wide variety of toys not covered specifically elsewhere including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>toy balloons</li><br/>  <li>toy kites</li><br/>  <li>toy tools and implements</li><br/>  <li>magic lanterns</li><br/>  <li>toy spectacles and sunglasses without prescription lenses or UV protection</li><br/>  <li>toy counting frames</li><br/>  <li>toy sewing machines</li><br/>  <li>toy clocks and watches</li><br/>  <li>toy walkie talkies</li><br/>  <li>toy play tents</li><br/>  <li>hoops and toy skipping ropes (skipping ropes intended for physical exercise are covered under heading code 9506)</li><br/>  <li>marbles</li><br/>  <li>toy money boxes</li><br/>  <li>babies’ rattles</li><br/>  <li>jack-in-the-boxes</li><br/>  <li>toy theatres</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-games"">Classifying games</h2><br/><br/><p>Most games are classified under the heading codes 9504 and 9505.

Not only is the great city of Glasgow hosting the Commonwealth Games, but also the Glasgow Grand Prix as well - and the UK government will do its part to make sure both are great sporting events.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The tax exemption the Treasury is announcing will extend the cultural and economic contribution that the Games will bring. It will also ensure Scotland continues to attract the highest standard of athletes.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, added:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">While athletes for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will compete with one another at the Commonwealth Games, the whole of the United Kingdom wants Glasgow 2014 to be a great success. By offering this additional tax break, we hope to ensure that the best athletes will come to Glasgow this summer for both this event and the Games itself.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Lord Smith of Kelvin, Chairman of  Glasgow 2014 said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Having this Grand Prix event in Glasgow and Scotland for the first time provides an  international showcase for Hampden Park, Scotland’s national stadium, our Commonwealth Games venue for Athletics – as well as the great global athletes who will come to compete.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Glasgow 2014 warmly welcomes this positive contribution from UK government which will play a key role in maximising opportunities to engage the Commonwealth’s elite international athletes in what will be an exciting build-up to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, the UK’s next big sporting event.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The one-off exemption will apply to all non-UK resident accredited competitors in the event to encourage more world-class international athletes to compete in the event, and has been granted on an exceptional basis.</p><br/><br/><p>It will not apply to any officials, sponsors, coaching staff or UK resident athletes who will continue to be liable to UK tax on any income which is related to their participation in the event. The exemption will not cover any other taxes such as corporation tax or VAT.</p><br/><br/><p>As announced in January 2012, a similar income tax exemption will also be provided for accredited competitors in the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, which is intended to help spread the Olympic legacy into Scotland and encourage top athletes to compete at the Commonwealth Games.</p><br/><br/><p>Image by <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/12648913@N02/3488695540/sizes/o/in/photolist-6jhtD7-6wzo9V-6yjxbP-6yjxKv-6yoG1G-6yoGym-6yoGNS-6yoHpb-6yoHWS-6G8ytk-b8ZV9D-b8ZWNn-b8ZXya-b8ZXbX-g4TdDv-85bb9T-gM3K7m-8Zqnog-e8PKVA-8Zsmn9-idHLNv-idHypx-idGULP-idHpHN-idHif5-idHLSD-idHg53-idHvty-idHrWW-d4xK1U-d4xKuQ-gJujpU-ceQ8Q9-ceQa1j-ceQ9eu-aE6tbb-d7WVJw-8YxPHT-dTa28o-8YCK9h-8YGzGa-8ZrTip-8YHEcv-8YBr7W-e8Pw75-8YJT5p-8YMpQo-8YKESw-8YMLhQ-8YTJXZ-e8JxpP/"">Sandeep Sajjala on Flickr</a>.

Some common examples are listed below:</p><br/><br/><p>Common terms used</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>alliaceous vegetables - vegetables that belong to the Allium plant family (see below)</li><br/>  <li>Allium - vegetables in the Allium family which include onions, shallots, leeks and garlic</li><br/>  <li>Brassica - vegetables in the brassica family which include cabbages, kale, brussels sprouts and cauliflowers</li><br/>  <li>Genus - group of similar plant types - the term forms the first part of the plant’s Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>Genera - plural of genus</li><br/>  <li>HS - Harmonised System that classifies commodities under different codes so that the correct duties and controls are applied to imports and exports</li><br/>  <li>HSENs - Harmonised System Explanatory Notes - these give useful guidance about the scope of the Tariff chapters, headings and subheadings</li><br/>  <li>leguminous vegetables - vegetables that belong to the Leguminosae plant family (see below)</li><br/>  <li>Leguminosae - vegetables in the Leguminosae family groupings include peas (pisum), beans (phaseolus and vigna) and lentils (lens)</li><br/>  <li>species - subdivision of a plant family or genus - it forms the second part of the Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>var. - variety, this indicates a subdivision of a species</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-frozen-vegetables"">Classifying frozen vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Frozen vegetables are classified under heading code 0710. They can be either uncooked, or cooked by steaming or boiling in water before being frozen.</p><br/><br/><p>Frozen vegetables must be maintained at a temperature of no more than -12°C. This must be consistent throughout the product, to make sure it’s thoroughly frozen right the way through.</p><br/><br/><p>If a frozen product is not frozen down to -12°C then it cannot be classified under heading code 0710. It must be classified as fresh or chilled. In particular, products described as ‘frozen garlic’ must be classified under heading code 0703 (fresh or chilled) if they do not meet the freezing temperature requirement.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as the types of vegetable specifically listed under subheading codes 0710 10 to 0710 90, the following are also classified under heading code 0710, if frozen to the required temperature:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>truffles</li><br/>  <li>capers</li><br/>  <li>marrows and pumpkins</li><br/>  <li>aubergines</li><br/>  <li>fennel and cress</li><br/>  <li>certain herbs, such as parsley and chervil</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-roots-and-tubers"">Classifying roots and tubers</h2><br/><br/><p>Certain roots and tubers with a high starch or inulin content are classified under heading code 0714. (Inulin is a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is extracted from certain roots). Products that are classified under this heading include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>manioc (or cassava)</li><br/>  <li>sweet potatoes</li><br/>  <li>Jerusalem artichokes</li><br/>  <li>arrowroot</li><br/>  <li>salep (flour made from the dried roots of orchids)</li><br/>  <li>sago pith</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products may be with or without skin. They can be fresh, chilled, frozen or dried, and may be whole, sliced or in pellet form. Subheading code 0714 10 00 91 covers pellets of manioc flour and meal. When dispersed in water, at least 95 per cent by weight of the pellet - calculated on the dry matter - must pass through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with a mesh size of 2 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""chinese-water-chestnuts"">Chinese water chestnuts</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading code 0714 also covers Chinese water chestnuts (tuberous roots of Eleocharis dulcis or Eleocharis tuberosa). Although they do not have a high starch content, they are included here because of their high inulin content. But the Caltrop variety of water chestnuts (nut-like fruit of Trapa natans) is classified as nuts in Chapter 8 under heading code 0802.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-leguminous-vegetables"">Classifying leguminous vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Leguminous vegetables are classified under heading code 0708 if they’re fresh or chilled, and under heading code 0713 if they’re dried. Dried products are included whether they’re intended for food use or for sowing.</p><br/><br/><p>Leguminous vegetables classified under these headings include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>peas (pisum sativum)</li><br/>  <li>beans (vigna, phaseolus species)</li><br/>  <li>broad beans and horse beans (vicia faba)</li><br/>  <li>chickpeas (garbanzos)</li><br/>  <li>lentils (lens)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Some legumes are not covered in Chapter 7 and are classified elsewhere. For example, soya beans are classified in Chapter 12 under heading code 1201. Locust beans are classified in the same chapter, under heading code 1212.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-provisionally-preserved-vegetables"">Classifying provisionally preserved vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Provisionally preserved vegetables are classified under heading code 0711. They must not be suitable for eating immediately. They’re generally packed in casks or barrels and are raw ingredients that have been provisionally preserved for transport and storage before being used in food manufacturing. They must stay in that state and remain unsuitable for immediate consumption.</p><br/><br/><p>So vegetables such as olives or gherkins that have been pickled in brine or vinegar and can be eaten straight from the jar are not provisionally preserved and are classified elsewhere. If they can be eaten with no further treatment or processing they’re classified in Chapter 20 under heading codes 2001, 2002, 2003 or 2005.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-herbs-and-spices"">Classifying herbs and spices</h2><br/><br/><p>There is no single classification in the Tariff for herbs. They can be covered in Chapter 7, Chapter 9 or Chapter 12, depending on their purpose and on the part of the plant they come from. For example, leaves are classified in a different chapter from seeds.</p><br/><br/><p>Some herbs are classified as vegetables and are covered under heading codes 0709 to 0712 in chapter 7. They include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>parsley</li><br/>  <li>chervil</li><br/>  <li>tarragon </li><br/>  <li>coriander leaves </li><br/>  <li>dill leaves </li><br/>  <li>sweet marjoram</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Some herbs are classified as spices and are covered in Chapter 9. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>thyme</li><br/>  <li>bay leaves</li><br/>  <li>dill seed</li><br/>  <li>coriander seed</li><br/>  <li>cumin seed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Chapter 12 covers herbs that are classified under heading code 1211 as types of plant used in perfumery, in pharmacy, or for insecticidal, fungicidal or similar purposes. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>basil</li><br/>  <li>borage</li><br/>  <li>hyssop</li><br/>  <li>mint</li><br/>  <li>rosemary</li><br/>  <li>rue</li><br/>  <li>ginseng roots</li><br/>  <li>sage</li><br/>  <li>wild marjoram (oregano)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Many of these herbs are also used in cooking, but they can never be classified in Chapter 7 as vegetables. They must always be classified under heading code 1211.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifications-and-latin-names-for-edible-vegetables"">Classifications and Latin names for edible vegetables</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Common Name</th><br/>      <th>Alternatives</th><br/>      <th>Latin Name</th><br/>      <th>Heading Code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Artichoke -

It has a shiny mirror-like surface. The varnish or lacquer used can be pigmented or non-pigmented and may be based on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>vegetable oil that dries and hardens - linseed oil is normally used</li><br/>  <li>cellulose derivatives like nitro-cellulose</li><br/>  <li>synthetic products (including thermoplastics) - polyurethane plastics are normally used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If preformed plastic sheet is used to coat the leather, it’s usually made from polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>).</p><br/><br/><p>The surface of patent leather is not necessarily smooth. It could be embossed, maybe to imitate crocodile skin, or artificially crushed, crinkled or grained. But it must still have a shiny mirror-like finish.</p><br/><br/><p>To be classified as patent leather, the thickness of the coating or sheet must not be more than 0.15 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather that is coated with pigmented paint or lacquer to give it a metallic sheen. These paints and lacquers consist of pigments like mica, silica and similar flakes in a binding substance like vegetable oil that dries and hardens, or plastic. Leather that’s been treated like this is known as ‘imitation metallised leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent laminated leather is leather that’s been coated with a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres but less than half the total thickness of the finished material. It has the same mirror-like finish as patent leather and is sometimes known as ‘patent coated leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>If the leather has been covered by a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres, but more than half the total thickness of the finished material, then it’s covered in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-saddlery-and-other-equipment-for-animals"">Classifying saddlery and other equipment for animals</h2><br/><br/><p>Saddlery and other equipment for animals are classified under heading code 4201.

The chapter is divided into sub-chapters I to XIII.</p><br/><br/><p>There are certain items that are specifically excluded from chapter 29 and classified in other chapters. These include products such as vitamins put up as food supplements, and compounds, such as paracetamol, intended for use as a medicament.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""chapter-29-heading-codes-quick-reference-table"">Chapter 29 heading codes: quick reference table</h2><br/><br/><p>This chapter covers organic chemicals. It also covers organic chemicals that are dissolved in water, or contain certain permitted additives.</p><br/><br/><p>The following list is not exhaustive, but it will help you check whether or not a particular item is likely to be covered in this chapter. For more detail, the European Customs Inventory of Chemicals (<abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr>) database can help you identify the right heading code for the chemicals covered in this chapter.</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Antibiotics</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Hormones</td><br/>      <td>2937</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Organo-sulphur compounds</td><br/>      <td>2930</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Organo-inorganic compounds</td><br/>      <td>2931</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Paracetamol</td><br/>      <td>2924</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Provitamins</td><br/>      <td>2936</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Streptomycin</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tetracycline</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Vitamins</td><br/>      <td>2936</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>This guidance covers the classification of separate chemically defined organic compounds (with or without impurities) in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff). They can be dissolved in water or if allowable in some other solvent, and contain certain permitted additives. They must be intended for general rather than specific use. For example, paracetamol in bulk is covered in this chapter, but if paracetamol is packaged as a medicament then it’s covered elsewhere. For help with classifying chemicals that are made up into measured doses or intended for retail sale, you can read the guide on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/classifying-pharmaceutical-products"">classifying pharmaceutical products</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>For detailed information on this sector, read the guide on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/chemicals"">chemicals</a>.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""defining-organic-chemicals"">Defining organic chemicals</h2><br/><br/><p>When you are classifying organic chemicals for the purposes of the Tariff you may come across certain terms and abbreviations. Some common examples are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""common-terms-used"">Common terms used</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Chemical Abstracts Service Registration Number (<abbr title=""Chemical Abstracts Service Registration Number"">CAS RN</abbr>) - a unique number allocated to a chemical by the American Chemical Society and used worldwide.</li><br/>  <li>Customs Union and Statistics number (<abbr title=""Customs Union and Statistics number"">CUS</abbr>).</li><br/>  <li>European Customs Inventory of Chemicals (<abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr>) - database containing details of the correct Tariff classification of both inorganic and organic chemicals.</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System (HS) - classifies commodities under different codes so that the correct duties and controls are applied to imports and exports.</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Notes"">HSENs</abbr>) - these give useful guidance about the scope of the Tariff chapters, headings and subheadings.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""permitted-additives-when-classifying-organic-chemicals"">Permitted additives when classifying organic chemicals</h2><br/><br/><p>As a general rule, chapter 29 is restricted to separate chemically defined organic compounds, subject to the provisions of note 1 to the chapter. To be covered in this chapter they must comply with strict conditions that specify which additives are allowed. These conditions are set out in Note 1a to Note 1g to chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><p>Compounds can be dissolved in water or in some other solvent. In the latter case, the solution must constitute a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and not to render the product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use. Stabilisers such as anti-caking agents can also be added, but only to preserve or transport the compound.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if an essential trace element such as chromium picolinate is prepared as a dietary supplement in the form of tablets or capsules, it would not be covered in this chapter. This is because the added ingredients, such as binder, the capsule shell and excipients, have not been added just to preserve or transport it. This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under code heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2936 specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>provitamins</li><br/>  <li>vitamins</li><br/>  <li>derivatives used mainly as vitamins</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of provitamins, vitamins and vitamin derivatives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Certain specified additives, such as anti-oxidants, are allowed so long as the amount added is just enough to preserve or transport the vitamins. However, vitamins put up in capsules for use as dietary supplements are not covered here. This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under code heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-organic-chemicals-and-suitability-for-general-use"">Classifying organic chemicals and suitability for general use</h2><br/><br/><p>When you classify a product in chapter 29 it’s important to ensure that anything added to a compound does not make the resulting product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use. For example vitamins and provitamins are normally covered under code heading 2936, but if they’re prepared as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules or caplets then they cannot be classified under this code heading. Because of the way they’re presented, with an intended daily dosage, they’re considered to be suitable for a specific use.</p><br/><br/><p>These types of product are also excluded from this code heading because the additives are used to do more than just preserve or transport the vitamins - they’re added to make the product convenient and easy to use.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-antibiotics"">Classifying antibiotics</h2><br/><br/><p>Antibiotics, such as penicillins and streptomycins, are classified under code heading 2941. This code heading covers compounds that have an antibiotic activity. They are substances produced by micro-organisms that can destroy or stop the growth of other micro-organisms. Substances that have low antibiotic activity are not covered under this code heading but are classified elsewhere in chapter 29, depending on their chemical structure.</p><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2941 also excludes certain other antibiotic products. Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>antibiotics that are intended to treat or prevent a disease or ailment (these are covered in chapter 30 under code heading 3003 or code heading 3004, depending on how they’re presented)</li><br/>  <li>antibiotic preparations of a kind used in animal feeding, ie a combination of a dried antibiotic with, for example, a cereal product - the antibiotic content is usually between 8% and 16% (these preparations are covered in chapter 23 under code heading 2309)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-organic-chemicals-and-chapter-notes-2-to-8"">Classifying organic chemicals and chapter Notes 2 to 8</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 29 has detailed notes to help with classifying chemicals. The guidance given in note 2 to note 8 provides information on certain specific chemicals and how to deal with certain classification issues.</p><br/><br/><p>A summary of these notes is included below:</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-2"">Note 2</h3><br/><br/><p>Exclusions of certain organic chemicals from chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-3"">Note 3</h3><br/><br/><p>Advises how to deal with organic chemicals that could be classified in two or more of the headings of chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-4"">Note 4</h3><br/><br/><p>Any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives under the following code headings includes a reference to compound derivatives in each case:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>code heading 2904 to 2906</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2908 to 2911</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2913 to 2920</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This Note also gives guidance on the interpretation of ‘nitrogen-functions’ and ‘oxygen-functions’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-5"">Note 5</h3><br/><br/><p>Note 5 covers a number of different compounds:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Note 5(A) and Note 5(B) give guidance on the correct code heading for classifying esters</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(C) (1) and (2) deal with salts of organic compounds</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(C) (3) covers co-ordination compounds</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(D) requires metal alcoholates to be classified under the same code heading as the corresponding alcohols - except in the case of ethanol (heading 2905)</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(E) covers halides of carboxylic acids</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-6"">Note 6</h3><br/><br/><p>This Note clarifies what is and what is not included under:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>code heading 2930 organo-sulphur compounds</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2931 other organo-inorganic compounds</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-7"">Note 7</h3><br/><br/><p>Code headings 2932, 2933 and 2934 do not include certain specific compounds. Note 7 lists the exclusions.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-8"">Note 8</h3><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2937 covers hormones. Note 8 explains what the term ‘hormone’ includes and to what it applies.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-29"">What’s not covered in chapter 29</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 29 covers separately defined organic compounds, provided they only contain certain permitted additives or they’re intended for a general - rather than a specific - use. Chemicals that do not meet these requirements are covered elsewhere. Some examples of products this chapter does not cover:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Compounds, such as paracetamol, put up as a medicament. These are covered in chapter 30.</li><br/>  <li>Disinfectants intended for retail sale or as preparations or articles. These are covered in chapter 38 under heading code 3808.</li><br/>  <li>Vitamins put up as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules, caplets and so on which have a recommended daily dosage. These are considered to be suitable for a specific use so they’re covered elsewhere. Many are covered in chapter 21 under heading code 2106. For more information on food supplements and dietary preparations, read our guide to classifying herbal medicines, supplements, tonics.</li><br/>  <li>Products that contain more ingredients than just the additives permitted for preserving or transporting the compound. These include vitamins mixed with other organic chemicals, or with minerals, herbs, other parts of plants, food ingredients and similar substances. This type of product is generally covered in chapter 21 or chapter 22, depending on its actual ingredients and the way it’s presented. For example, tonic drinks containing vitamins and other ingredients and intended for immediate consumption are covered in chapter 22.</li><br/>  <li>Feed supplements for animals that contain vitamins and other ingredients - such as cereals and proteins. These are covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309.</li><br/>  <li>Antibiotics intended for therapeutic or prophylactic uses. These are covered in chapter 30 under heading code 3003 or heading code 3004, depending on how they’re presented. You can read our guide to classifying pharmaceutical products for help with classifying chemicals that are made up into measured doses or intended for retail sale.</li><br/>  <li>Antibiotic preparations used in animal feeding - for example a dried antibiotic mass on a carrier like cereal middlings. The antibiotic content is usually between 8% and 16%. This type of preparation is covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309.</li><br/>  <li>Products that have been produced as part of the antibiotics manufacturing process and are intended to be processed further. These are covered in Chapter 38 under heading code 3824 (they’re referred to as ‘intermediate products’).</li><br/>  <li>Certain chemicals, such as crude glycerol, are specifically excluded from this chapter and are classified elsewhere. These chemicals are listed in Note 2a to Note 2k to chapter 29.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""chapter-notes"">Chapter notes</h3><br/><p>Section VI of the Tariff, which includes chapter 29, has detailed notes covering the products classified in this chapter. Chapter 29 also has its own classification notes. When classifying organic chemicals, you should refer to these notes for specific guidance.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""combined-products-or-sets"">Combined products (or sets)</h3><br/><p>Some products are made up by combining two or more separate elements, or constituents. Some or all of these constituents may be covered in Section VI as products of the chemical or allied industries. They are intended to be mixed together to produce a product that’s covered either in Section VI or in Section VII. These combined products, or sets, are classified under the heading code appropriate to the finished product if the constituents are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>put up in such a way that it’s clear that they’re to be used together without first being repacked<br/>presented together</li><br/>  <li>complementary to one another, either because of their nature or because of the proportions in which they’re combined</li><br/>  <li>chemicals which could be covered under more than one heading code</li><br/>  <li>some items could be classified under two or more heading codes in this chapter. If so, the heading code that comes last in numerical order is the one to use. This does not apply to subheading codes.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""ecics""><abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr></h3><br/><p>It can be difficult to classify organic chemicals correctly for the purposes of the Tariff.

Thank you very much Ian.  Thanks for that introduction.  Thank you for the welcome.  It’s great to be back in Birmingham, great to be with you at PwC.</p><br/><br/><p>And, as Ian has just said, we’ve got 78 days to go before the most important political decision that most of us will make in our lifetimes: whether to stay in or to leave a reformed European Union.  And it is in many ways bigger than a general election.  If you don’t like the choice you make in a general election, you can change your mind in 5 years’ time and chuck them out.  Obviously that’s not a bit that I particularly look forward to but nonetheless it’s a very powerful part of our system.</p><br/><br/><p>But this choice about Europe, it is a choice for a generation, a choice for a lifetime: do we stay in or do we go?  Now I’m very clear that the best answer is to stay in.  I think we are better off in; I think we’re stronger in; I think we’re safer in, and I want to say a word about each of those.</p><br/><br/><p>Safer, because of course what really ensures our safety is our police, our intelligence service, our relationships around the world, but there’s no doubt in my mind, having been your Prime Minister for 6 years, that the European Union, the work we do with our partners, the information we get about criminals, about terrorists, that helps to keep us safer.</p><br/><br/><p>I believe we’re stronger in as a country because of course we’re the fifth biggest economy in the world.  We get strength through our membership of NATO, through our membership of the Commonwealth, through our relationship with the United States of America where I was last week, but we do get strength as well by being part of the European Union.  We’re there, able to make decisions, whether it’s putting sanctions on Iran, so they don’t have a nuclear weapon or whether it is having a united front against Putin and what he’s done in the Ukraine.  We are stronger because we are in the European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>I also think we have the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-best-of-both-worlds-the-united-kingdoms-special-status-in-a-reformed-european-union"">best of both worlds</a>.  Our membership of European Union is not quite like anybody else’s.  We’re in the single market but we’re out of the single currency.  We can work and travel all over Europe, but we maintain our borders and we don’t have to let people into our country if we think they are a threat to us.  So I think we have the best of both worlds and that has got better with my negotiation because I’ve made sure they cannot discriminate against the pound sterling, our currency.  I’ve made sure we have targets for burden reduction.  I’ve made sure that we’ll never be part of an ever closer political union.</p><br/><br/><p>But I think the most powerful case for staying in and the one I want to mention the most before answering your questions, is that we are better off; we are wealthier; we’re more prosperous; we’ll create more jobs; we’ll create more livelihoods for people in our country if we stay in a reformed European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>The European Union is effectively a market of 500 million people, and a market we can sell to without quotas, without tariffs, without taxes, without any impediment.  And when you think of Britain, when you think of Birmingham, when you think of the West Midlands, we are a trading nation, we need those markets open.  That is how we create jobs.  Around a quarter of a million jobs here in the West Midlands are dependent on trade with Europe.</p><br/><br/><p>Now of course that trade wouldn’t disappear altogether if we were to leave the European Union, but what would be in its place in terms of the rules?  What sort of deal would we have?  And here’s where I think your industries, and the industries you support, in the services sector need to think about this so carefully.  Because the truth is this: services make up 80% of the British economy, 4 fifths of the British economy.  And it’s absolutely vital for our services industries that we have full access to that European single market.  Now if we leave the EU, we therefore have to have some sort of deal with the EU to give us access.  Now here’s the absolutely key choice: if we went for a deal like Norway which is out of the European Union but almost a full member of the single market, you’d still have to pay into the EU, like Norway does, and accept the free movement of people from the EU, like Norway does, and yet you’d have no say over the rules that govern trade or services or standards or anything else.  Now that’s not a good deal.  And you don’t just have to take that from me; that is the view of the Norwegian Prime Minister as well.  They say to us, ‘Don’t go for the Norway option.’</p><br/><br/><p>So the alternative to that would be a free trade agreement.  Now Canada has, or is about to have, the biggest free trade agreement there is with the European Union, and some of the principal proponents of Britain leaving the EU have said we should have a Canada-style deal.  But here’s the rub: the Canada-style deal does not have really any good provisions about services.</p><br/><br/><p>Let me just give you a couple of examples.  A Canadian airline can fly between Canada and a European city, but it can’t fly within Europe.  Well what would that mean for easyJet or for Ryanair, for companies like that, that are so vital in terms of the cheap air flights that we all enjoy?  Let me give you another example.  If you’re a television station, if you’re located in Britain, you can broadcast all the way through the European Union; not if you’re a Canadian television station under the deal.  Think of financial services, and you help so many financial services companies.  With our arrangements, inside the single market, if you’re located in Britain you can trade in any European country.  If you’re Canada, your financial services companies won’t be able to do that.  They’d have to set up in each and every European country.</p><br/><br/><p>So here’s the truth; if we leave the European Union, and if we have a deal like a Canada free trade deal, it will be very bad for our economy.  It will be bad for jobs.  It will be bad for investment.  And it will be particularly bad for services industries that need those markets open.  We have a brilliant manufacturing sector in Britain; it’s important that we keep it going, not least with the huge success of Jaguar Land Rover not far away from here.  But we’re also the people that design the building, that consult on the deal, that insure the premises, that provide those vital services, those sales and other services right throughout the European Union.  And I think that above all is the reason why we should reject the idea of a free trade deal and recognise we are better off inside a European Union.  And that’s how I hope you’ll vote in 78 days’ time.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>Read more about <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternatives-to-membership-possible-models-for-the-united-kingdom-outside-the-european-union"">Alternatives to membership: possible models for the United Kingdom outside the European Union</a>.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><p>But I just want to make one final point before taking your questions, because I think a lot of these arguments can always be quite dry, quite technical.  They’re about jobs and investment, vitally important, but there’s also something else we should always think about when we consider this question of in or out.  And that is it may be 78 days until that referendum, but it is also only 70 years ago that the countries of Europe were fighting each other and killing each other’s citizens in huge numbers.</p><br/><br/><p>And yes it’s frustrating, the European Union, and I can tell you, as the person who sits round that table till often 3 or 4 in the morning, negotiating complex deals, it can be incredibly frustrating.  But the fact that we talk to each other, the fact that we work with each other, the fact that we try and collaborate and cooperate to tackle the problems and issues that we face as countries is so much better than what came before and we should never forget that, whereas our continent had been wracked by war and conflict, we have found a way now to talk to each other, to work together.  And that is something, when we think about this vote – which is not just for our generation but it’s for our children and our grandchildren – something that I hope we’ll think about.</p><br/><br/><p>Thank you again for the welcome.  I look forward to the questions.  Whatever you decide to do, please do vote in 78 days’ time.  People say there’s a lot of issues of sovereignty at stake in this referendum.  Well, this is a giant act of sovereignty.  You, the British people, are going to decide: do we stay in or do we get out?  I hope you vote to stay in, particularly after the negotiation I concluded, but it’s your choice.  I will obey the orders you give me on 23 June.  Thank you very much.</p><br/><br/><p>Right, okay.  Questions, points?  We’ve got some from the press here as well.  Let’s have the lady behind me.  Here comes a microphone; you may not need it, but just so they get you all the way up there.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Hi, Eleanor Perfect.  I’m the EU grants lead for PwC UK, so I work with PwC clients to access Horizon 2020 funding.  What’s the plan if we vote to leave, to mitigate the…?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-1"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very good point.  In case everybody doesn’t know, the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/horizon-2020"">Horizon 2020 programme</a>, that is the money particularly for universities, where Britain actually does extremely well out of science and technology and university funding.  If we look at the West Midlands as a whole, I think there’s about £700 million worth of European regional funding coming into the West Midlands between now and 2020.</p><br/><br/><p>Now of course, if we left the EU we would have to make sure we funded science in our universities, and we had the other regional funds equivalent to those things.  But you know, we can’t guarantee what it would be.  And in a way, it’s a question for the Out campaign to answer: would you replicate the very important funding that’s going into British universities or wouldn’t you?  But it is interesting that British universities, by and large, are solidly behind staying in a reformed European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>And also, there’s this point: if we left the EU, it’s pretty clear – and the Bank of England have said this – there would be a shock to our economy and we would suffer in terms of a fall in our currency, a fall in our GDP and our output, and we’d be less able to fund vital science and other projects like the Horizon programme.  So if we stay in, we know what we’re going to get, and we know that we can keep on winning for British universities, for British science; if we get out, we can’t guarantee that.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have a couple more before we go to the press.  Gentleman here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-1"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you very much.  Phil Harrold, PwC.  I lead our automotive practice in the UK, and the automotive industry is in the best health it’s been for over 40 years.  What’s the government going to do to maintain conditions for that health?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-2"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I think – look, it is a really big success story.  If I think back to my childhood, and what was going on in the motor industry then and all the difficulties we had in the 70s, you can see a situation transformed.  We are now the third largest manufacturer of automotive vehicles, of cars, in the European Union, after Germany and Spain.  We actually make more cars in the North East of our country, principally Nissan, than they do in the whole of Italy.</p><br/><br/><p>So this is a huge success story for Britain, and I would argue the success is based on great design and manufacturing skills, very good industrial relations.  But it’s also based on the fact that we are part of the European Union, and so the companies that come and invest here – whether it’s an Indian company in the case of Jaguar Land Rover, or whether it is the Japanese companies Nissan and Honda and Toyota – they come and invest here knowing they have complete access to that single market.</p><br/><br/><p>Now, if we went for a Canada‑style trade deal, we’d have to meet all sorts of rules about the origin of all the parts of our cars, and we wouldn’t necessarily get that tariff‑free access to the single market.  So if you put yourself in the mind of the Japanese car company, or Tata’s future investment in terms of Jaguar Land Rover, what would be better?  Is it better to stay in a reformed European Union, knowing you’ve got access to that market, or is it better to take a risk?  It must be better to stay in.  And I know if we vote to stay in, we’ll continue to support the car industry in the way that we have.  I think that what we’re doing, particularly on apprenticeships and skills, is a really, really strong future for that industry, and I want to see it grow.</p><br/><br/><p>And we – you know, you have to think through what would happen on 24 June and afterwards if we vote to come out.  We’re then going to spend years trying to renegotiate our relationship with Europe, and that is going to lead to huge uncertainty.  And if there’s one thing businesses hate, it is uncertainty and a lack of knowledge about what the access to the market is going to be.  So I think it’s a good example of why we should vote to stay in on 23 June.</p><br/><br/><p>Lady here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-2"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Sarah Marshall, PwC.  The ‘Midlands Engine’ has been mentioned in the last 2 consecutive Budgets without a lot of detail being out there.  If we stay in, how will you ensure that we remain top of the agenda?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-3"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very important point.  Look, I would say – I sometimes think the West Midlands thinks that it’s going to miss out because of this thing called the Northern Powerhouse, and I think that’s mistaken thinking.  I think for a long time in our country we’ve been too unbalanced in terms of too much of the economic activity has been in London and the south-east.  And the Northern Powerhouse is not about favouring the north over the West Midlands, it’s about trying to rebalance the whole country, and to create an alternative centre of strength and excellence – in manufacturing, in universities, in transport and all the rest of it – to make us a more balanced country.  And that actually is of huge benefit to the West Midlands, because West Midlands will then draw its strength not only from the fact that Birmingham is the country’s second city, but also its connectivity to London and the south, and to Manchester and Leeds and Liverpool in the north; it will draw strength from both.</p><br/><br/><p>And at the same time, we are putting a lot of investment into Birmingham.  If you think of one of the biggest investments this government’s made over the last 5 years, it’s actually the complete renewal of Birmingham New Street station; something that was absolutely vital for our country.  The biggest project coming up next is HS2, which I think has got huge benefits for Birmingham, not just in terms of journey speed and capacity, but also big regeneration of key parts of Birmingham.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think you’ll hear a lot more about the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/midlands-engine-regeneration-opportunities-pitchbook"">West Midlands Engine</a>, and I think you’ll also see this coming‑together of the local authorities in the West Midlands to try and form one West Midlands authority with one mayoral figure, who I think will be able to help drive the investment that’s needed in the West Midlands.  So I think it’s a very positive picture: if you put together transport, connectivity and the governance that’s going to change, I think it’s a very strong picture.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have Faisal Islam from Sky News.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-3"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you, Prime Minister.  The leader of the opposition has called for an investigation into your tax affairs for your own interests.  Can you clarify for the record that you and your family have not derived any benefit in the past, and will not in the future, from the offshore Blairmore Holdings fund mentioned in the Panama Papers?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-4"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Sure.  Look, what we need – the investigation we need, first of all, is for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs"">HMRC</a>, our tax authority, to use all the information that is coming out of Panama to make sure that everything is done to make sure that companies and individuals are paying their taxes properly.  In many ways, what’s coming out of Panama is actually what we’re introducing in our own country, which is a register of beneficial ownership so everyone can see who owns what company.</p><br/><br/><p>As for my – the 2 things I’m responsible for are my own financial affairs and for the tax system of the United Kingdom.  In terms of my own financial affairs, I own no shares.  I have a salary as Prime Minister, and I have some savings which I get some interest from, and I have a house which we used to live in which we now let out while we’re living in Downing Street.  And that’s all I have; I have no shares, no offshore trusts, no offshore funds, nothing like that.  And so that, I think, is a very clear description.</p><br/><br/><p>The second thing I’m responsible for is, of course, our tax system and for international tax policy.  And I would say that no government, no prime minister has done more to make sure we crack down on tax evasion, on aggressive tax avoidance, on aggressive tax planning, both here in the UK and internationally.  So we have recovered billions of pounds in our country by changing tax regulations and rules in Budget after Budget, billions of pounds.  But we’ve also led the world in making sure we have, which we’ll have in June, an open register of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-g20-beneficial-ownership-implementation-plan"">beneficial ownership</a> so everyone can see who owns what in Britain.</p><br/><br/><p>We haven’t just done that here in the UK, we’ve also pioneered that abroad.  We’ve said, for instance, to the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies that they have to have the automatic exchange of tax information, they have to have a single standard for reporting company taxation, and they too need to do registers of beneficial ownership.  And we’ve made huge progress on that with the Overseas Territories, with the Crown Dependencies, and other countries as well.  I started this at the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/g8-communique-and-documents"">G8 summit in Northern Ireland</a>, some years ago, and we’ve now got country after country sharing tax information, committing to beneficial ownership registers which we never had before.</p><br/><br/><p>Is there more to do?  Absolutely.  Am I committed to doing it?  Absolutely, and the anti‑corruption summit that we’re holding in London on 12 May will be yet another sort of mark along the way of making sure we deliver on this absolutely vital agenda.  We have low taxes here in Britain, but low taxes that people must pay, and that is our agenda and we’re going to stick to it.</p><br/><br/><p>Lady here?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-4"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you.  Lauren McCafferty, PwC.  Ian opened today talking about student talent and the importance of graduates to our business, and you’ve touched on some of the key arguments that would appeal to those.  I work in student recruitment myself, so I am incredibly passionate about it.  There are a lot of complex arguments coming out of both sides of the debate.  What personal message would you want to give to students who are perhaps voting for the first time in their lives to summarise the key points for them that they should consider in staying in?  Thank you.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-5"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I think to young people it is all about the opportunities of the future.  If we stay in a reformed European Union, you have the opportunity to work, to live, to travel, to study in all these different European countries, and I think that is an exciting and compelling world to live in.</p><br/><br/><p>If, on the other hand, we leave, you start your working life with probably a decade of uncertainty.  What is our relationship with the rest of Europe?  What trade deals are we going to have with other countries in the world?  What are my rights going to be if I want to go work in Spain or if I want to go travel or live in other countries?</p><br/><br/><p>So I think you’re swapping the certainty of knowing that, however this – imperfect this organisation can be, there’s lots of opportunity within it, and particularly for a country like Britain that has a special status within it.  You are swapping that for uncertainty and for something of a leap in the dark.  And I think, for people who’ve been to university, who’ve got an opportunity or people coming through school who want to do an apprenticeship, we know that what we’ve got can work for you in this organisation.  Don’t put that at risk.</p><br/><br/><p>Because this is a decision – as I say, it is not a decision you take now and then you reverse in 4 or 5 years’ time if you don’t like it, like you can with a government; this is a decision for the next generation.  So I think the younger generation need to think very carefully about what this all means.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have the Express &amp; Star.  Sir.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-5"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you.  Mr Cameron, have EU regulations harmed the British steel industry to the extent that we can’t compete with foreign import?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-6"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>No, I don’t believe they have.  Look, we’ve got a very difficult situation with the steel industry in our country, just as other countries do, because we’ve got massive global over capacity, a collapse in global prices and this makes a real challenge for our steel industry.  But we’ve got a government that’s determined to help in every way that we can.  I <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-welsh-first-minister-carwyn-jones-5-april-2016"">met this morning with the Welsh First Minister</a> to talk about all the things that we can do.  We’ve already helped on energy.  We’ve already helped on procurement.  We now want to make sure that Tata are looking seriously at a potential buyer for this business, and all of the business; I think it’s very important to say that.</p><br/><br/><p>And then you’d have to ask yourself the question, well would we be better off trying to do this if we were outside the European Union?  And my answer is no, we wouldn’t.  More than half of British steel goes to the European Union.  We need those markets to be open for our steel.  And if we were outside the European Union, we could be subject to those anti-dumping tariffs that the European Union is quite rightly applying to the Chinese and to other countries.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think there is a certain strength in numbers when you’re dealing with other countries in this way.  Britain is a big economy.  Fifth largest in the world.  But we are 60 million people, which, when added together with the other 440 million people in the European Union, means that we have serious power as a trading bloc, as a trading bloc in our negotiations with China or with America.</p><br/><br/><p>And I think sometimes people can think that, just because you have friendly relations with a country, you automatically get a good trade deal from it.  Now we have very friendly relations with the United States of America, no doubt about it.  But right now, how much British beef or British lamb do you think they’re buying in America?  Zero, none.  They have put some sort of block on it for, I think, very phoney reasons.  So even though you’ve got a friendly relationship, that doesn’t necessarily lead to friendly tariff and friendly trade regimes.</p><br/><br/><p>It is a tough trading world out there.  We need those European markets open.  We need strength in numbers through Europe to make sure we crack down on the dumping of Chinese and other steel, and Britain is leading the way in making sure that happens.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have, lady here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-6"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Hello.  How diverse do you think the UK government is?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-7"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very good question.  We were talking about this a bit earlier.  Not as diverse as it should be, but I think we have made some important steps forward.  We’ve now got – sitting around the cabinet table, one third of the people round the cabinet table are women, which is a big change from when I first came into politics.  When I became leader of the Conservative party, I think we had 17 or 18 women MPs; we’ve now got over 70.  So that’s a big change, but as we’ve got 300 – more than 300 MPs, it’s not enough.</p><br/><br/><p>In terms of diversity in terms of the ethnic diversity of Parliament, that’s changed a lot in recent years and I think that is really positive.  And if I look around my cabinet table, we were just talking about the steel industry, and my Business Secretary, his dad came from Pakistan to drive the busses in London, and in one generation his son is sitting around the cabinet table responsible for one of the most important portfolios in government.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think we are becoming more diverse.  I think we do need not positive discrimination but positive action, you need to make sure that people can make it right to the top and you need to demonstrate that, because I think role models are so important in this, and I’m sure you find this in PwC.  It’s all very well saying we’re an equal opportunities employer, we’re all based on merit, you can go as high as your talent allows.  That’s great, but if you open the door and all you see is a sea of white male faces, it’s not very encouraging.</p><br/><br/><p>So I have always believed, if you want to have a more diverse workforce, have a more diverse leadership, change your country in that way, you need to take some quite strong positive action to make sure that we access all of the talent of the country.  And that is the key point in the end.</p><br/><br/><p>This is not about political correctness; this is about effectiveness.  PwC would not be half as effective as it is if it locked out women and people from Britain’s ethnic minorities into its teams.  My wife would say it would be considerably less than 50% efficient if that was the case.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-7"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Say, for example, if we do end up having to leave the EU, people vote that they don’t want to stay, for European companies who’ve invested in the – invested in the UK, what impact would it have on them, and what incentive would they have to stay?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-8"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well, very good question.  What – in case everyone didn’t hear, for the foreign companies that invested in the UK, if we were to leave the EU, what effect would it have on them?  The short answer is that you can’t say for certain until you know what the alternative arrangements are that Britain would put in place.  And so it’s really a question the Leave campaign have got to answer.</p><br/><br/><p>But the truth is this: if we opted for a situation like Norway, which is basically almost a member of the single market, the situation wouldn’t change very much because those companies would still have access to European markets, but Norway pays into the EU about the same per head of population as we do.  So the people who say I want to get out of Europe because I want to stop contributing to the budget, well the Norway solution doesn’t help.  Ditto when it comes to the free movement of people.  Norway has to sign up to the free movement of people, so anyone from another EU country can go and live and work in Norway.  In fact, they won’t even have my welfare deal where, under my new arrangements, you don’t get full access to our welfare system if you come from another European country for 4 years.</p><br/><br/><p>So that’s the Norway answer, which would be reassuring, I think, to foreign investors and other European investors who’ve come to build plants and businesses in Britain.  But that’s not what the Leave campaigners say they want, because they don’t want to pay in to the EU, and they don’t want free movement of people.</p><br/><br/><p>So therefore you have to look at a free trade deal.  And the longer you look at these free trade deals, the more you can see, they take a very long time to come in.  The Canada one has been 7 years in negotiation and still hasn’t been passed.  So you’ve got 7 years of uncertainty; 7 years of the Japanese car company thinking, ‘Shall I put more investment in Britain or not?’; 7 years of, you know, the Indian company thinking, ‘Should I invest more in this great automotive business or should I put that money somewhere else?’</p><br/><br/><p>And then if you do go for a Canada-style free trade deal, you may well find that you don’t have the access to the market that you used to have.  So I was looking at this Canada free trade deal, and this is relevant, I think, to your business.  They don’t have automatic access to all European markets for their accountancy businesses.  Indeed, in France you have to have the permission, I think, of the Finance Ministry in order to set up a bookkeeping business in France.</p><br/><br/><p>And you lay yourself open as a country, and as a group of companies, and as an economy, to putting yourself into a very difficult situation, where of course the French accountancy firms will be saying, ‘Well don’t let the Brits in.  Let’s favour our own accountancy firms.’  You know, you’d get car manufacturers in Spain lobbying their government, saying, ‘Well don’t give them a good free trade deal.  Let’s have more cars made in Spain.’</p><br/><br/><p>These are all things that cannot happen now because we have this unimpeded access to this market of 500 million people.  And that is why I think for us to vote to leave the European Union would be an act of economic and political self-harm to our country, which is why I am going to campaign very hard in the next 78 days to say that we really should not take this step.</p><br/><br/><p>And I’ll say again what I’ve said before.  I’m not standing to be your Prime Minister again at the next election.  I’ve got no other agenda here than saying what I think after 6 years of being your Prime Minister is the best thing for our country, for our economy, for our businesses, for our families.  And I have no hesitation in saying, yes, there are frustrations with this organisation, but we are better off, we are stronger, we are safer if we stay inside it.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>Prime Minster.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-9"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Let’s just take a couple more and then we’ll have one more from the press.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-8"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>I think you’ve touched a – thank you.  I think you touched a little bit on diversity and [inaudible] as well.  I know this is about EU, but Theresa May has been making it really hard for people from non-EU backgrounds to be working here.  What is your stance on that?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-10"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I agree with Theresa May.  I mean, that’s – we’re in the cabinet together, so we’d have to agree with each other.  But look, the point is this –</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker-1"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>You haven’t always though.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-11"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>I know.  The point is this, we have had very big pressure in terms of migration into the UK.  It’s been running at, you know, well over 100,000 a year, sometimes 200,000 a year or more going back for around a decade now.  And people want us and I want us to control immigration.  Immigration is good for the country.  It is good that people come and work here and make their home here and contribute, but you do need to try and have a control over the numbers and a control over the pressures.</p><br/><br/><p>And so what we’ve done is say, well we’re going to attack this – deal with this problem in 2 ways.  First of all, for people coming from outside the EU, we put a cap on economic migration of some 20,000 a year, and we put in place some restrictions so that students can come, but they must be genuine students to genuine universities.  We’ve closed down dozens of bogus colleges.</p><br/><br/><p>So that’s how we’ve approached the issue of migration from outside the EU but I know it does sometimes cause frustrations inside the EU where there is the right to go and live and work in other European countries, just as we have the right to go and work in their countries.  So the approach we’ve taken there is on welfare, which is we have a very generous in-work welfare system.  People can earn as much as, you know, £8,000, £9,000, £10,000 of tax credits when they come to our country.  So that’s why we’ve negotiated this unique ability for the next 7 years to be able to say you don’t get full access to our welfare system until you’ve been here for 4 years.  And I think that’s a very positive way of saying, yes we want people to come but we want people to pay in before they get out.  No something for nothing.</p><br/><br/><p>So this does create difficulties and problems, and I know there can be pressures for more people who want to come, but I think both inside the EU and outside the EU, we need to have that controlled immigration, which is what we’re delivering.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-9"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Prime Minister, as you can see we’re a people business, so how would an in vote benefit the employment market as we run up to 2020?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-12"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>The employment market?  Well I mean, first of all the good news is over the last 6 years we’ve seen something like 2.3 million more people in work, so we are a job factory.  We’ve been creating a lot of jobs in our country, and this has put on some of the immigration pressure.  And I would say the best thing we can do is keep going with the economic plan that we’ve got.  It’s a plan that’s working and one of the things that could upset the plan is creating uncertainty.  And one of the ways we create jobs is having access to Europe’s markets, making sure we complete these trade deals with North America, with India, with China, and that I think is the best way to secure jobs and secure growth.</p><br/><br/><p>Whereas the uncertainty of maybe 7, maybe 10 years of not knowing exactly what your relationship is with Europe, what your trade deals are with the rest of the world, companies wondering about whether they’re going to come in and invest here, companies that are already here thinking about should we grow more in Britain or should we go somewhere else, that is uncertainty that we do not need.</p><br/><br/><p>And that is why, as I said, I think there are so many good arguments for staying in a reformed EU: the argument about safety and fighting terrorism, the argument about Britain’s strength in the world and being able to get things done.  But I do think the strongest single argument is this issue of our economy, of jobs, of people’s prosperity, because, in the end, that is what I think people want to know.  What is my best chance of securing a good future for myself and for my family, having a job, being able to contribute and deliver in that way?  That’s the most important thing, and that’s the question I think people should have in their minds as they go into the polling booth.</p><br/><br/><p>Can I say you’ve been a really brilliant audience?  Thank you very much for the welcome, thank you for all you do at PwC.  I can see you have achieved a very diverse and very strong workforce, and it’s been great to come here to Birmingham and join you today.</p><br/><br/><p>Thank you very much indeed.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker-2"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you, Prime Minister.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>Find out more on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-best-of-both-worlds-the-united-kingdoms-special-status-in-a-reformed-european-union"">the UK’s special status in a reformed EU</a> and <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternatives-to-membership-possible-models-for-the-united-kingdom-outside-the-european-union"">alternatives to EU membership</a>.</p><br/></div><br/><br/></div></p>",

On the visit to Beefeater today (12th May), Exchequer Secretary Damian Hinds was told by spirit industry leaders that this number may fall if the UK leaves the European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>Industry leaders who met the Exchequer Secretary warned that losing access to the EU single market, which makes overseas trade far easier for highly regulated industries such as alcohol, could mean that UK producers won’t be able to trade as freely due to the loss of EU common standards.</p><br/><br/><p>A recent survey carried out by the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) found that the UK wine and spirit trade will be stronger if Britain remained in the European Union. As part of a consultation of its 300 plus members this message was endorsed by 90% of those who responded.</p><br/><br/><p>Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Damian Hinds said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The UK’s gin industry is undergoing a remarkable renaissance with the rest of the world developing a taste for our world-leading gin. The message from industry voices and famous gin makers like Beefeater is clear; leaving the EU would hit exports hard and could apply the brakes to the gin boom. I believe that gin like the rest of our spirits industry will be stronger, safer and better off within a reformed EU.</p><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><br/>  <p>The great tradition of British gin making is supported by remaining in Europe - for both exporting and quality reasons. Exports of gin have risen by 46% in the past five years, with sales to 139 countries, worth £2.18 billion over that period. In 2015 alone the UK exported £231 million worth of gin to non EU countries and an impressive £189 million to consumers inside the EU’s single market.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Without the benefit of the quality standards underpinned by the European definition of gin our producers and their brands could find themselves with fewer consumers, fewer trading partners and a less glowing global reputation.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Laurent Lacassagne, Chairman &amp; CEO of Chivas Brothers, owner of Beefeater gin said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>While this is clearly a decision that will be and should be made by the UK public, Chivas Brothers believes that being part of the EU supports the continued success and future of spirits made in and exported from the UK like gin and Scotch whisky.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The EU’s single market, such as its regulation of food and drink, combined with its single trade policy, are vital to our industry and our brands. The result is fair access to markets, which in turn supports jobs, growth and the industry in the long-term.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>During his visit Mr Hinds toured the distillery and saw how the historic Beefeater gin is made. <br/>According to the WSTA a total of 1.6 billion gin and tonics were sold globally in 2014 and almost 140 million bottles of gin made in the UK are now exported every year.</p><br/><br/><p>Government statistics also show that between 2010 and 2015 a total of 174 new spirit distilleries opened in the UK - with 56 new licences issued in the past year alone. The number of UK gin brands has more than doubled since 2010 from 31 to 73 due to the demand for new brands.</p><br/><br/><p>Following the Chancellor’s 2% cut to spirits duty last year, duty on spirits was frozen at Budget 2016. Duty on a bottle of gin remains £7.26. The tax is 81p lower since ending the spirits duty escalator in 2014.</p><br/></div></p>",

There are however, exceptions to this.</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><h2 id=""what-is-meant-by-disrepair"">What is meant by disrepair</h2><br/><br/><p>A property might be in disrepair because:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>it has fallen into disrepair over time</li><br/>  <li>it has been damaged</li><br/>  <li>it has been vandalised</li><br/>  <li>there has been a fire or a flood</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""rateable-value-and-disrepair"">Rateable value and disrepair</h2><br/><br/><p>Legislation provides a definition of rateable value that applies to all properties. Rateable value represents the rental value of a property if it was let at the standard valuation date on the basis that the tenant pays for all repairs during the letting. The definition includes an assumption that the property is let in a state of reasonable repair.</p><br/><br/><p>As a general rule disrepair does not affect a property’s rateable value, however there are exceptions:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the property is in such a state of disrepair that a reasonable landlord would consider the repair costs to be uneconomic</li><br/>  <li>the property is in such a state of disrepair that a reasonable landlord might repair only part of it</li><br/>  <li>the property has been so badly damaged by fire or flooding that it can’t be economically repaired and used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If a reasonable landlord would consider it uneconomic to do the repairs, then the rental valuation will be based on the basis of the actual state of repair.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-is-meant-by-repair"">What is meant by repair</h2><br/><br/><p>Repair only covers fixing any parts of the property that are in disrepair. It should be repaired to a standard that is expected for a property of its age, character, locality and the type of tenant likely to occupy it.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, the expected standard of repair for a modern office building would be much higher than that for an old warehouse.</p><br/><br/><p>Repair can include an element of renewal but not improvement. This means, for example, that a leaking flat roof would usually be patch repaired to make it watertight and not fully replaced with a slated pitch roof.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""uneconomic-to-repair"">Uneconomic to repair</h2><br/><br/><p>A property is considered uneconomic to repair if the repair costs are so out of proportion to the rental value that a reasonable landlord would not spend the money doing them. This is because it would be unlikely they would get an adequate return on the investment and it would not be financially worthwhile.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""properties-being-repaired"">Properties being repaired</h2><br/><br/><p>If work is being undertaken to repair a property, this is considered in just the same way as a property needing repair. If the works would be considered economically reasonable then the property is treated as already being in reasonable repair for rating.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""alterations-being-carried-out-to-a-property"">Alterations being carried out to a property</h2><br/><br/><p>It may be that the rateable value of a property can be reduced whilst the work is underway, depending on the extent of the work being carried out to improve, extend or enhance it. Each case will be considered on its own facts.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""if-you-believe-your-property-is-in-uneconomic-repair"">If you believe your property is in ‘uneconomic repair’</h2><br/><br/><p>If you don’t feel that it’s cost effective to repair your property, you should tell the VOA using their <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates"">online service</a> as soon as possible. You need to provide all the evidence that your property is in a state of substantial disrepair, so that the valuation officer can investigate.</p><br/><br/><p>Useful evidence includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>photographs of the repairs required and the extent of those repairs</li><br/>  <li>an itemised estimate of repair costs and work required</li><br/>  <li>the history of occupation and use of the premises</li><br/>  <li>future plans or proposals for the occupation and use of the building, including any planning applications or permissions</li><br/>  <li>where the property is being altered, a schedule of the work being undertaken which details each stage and the point in time when that stage began</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The VOA will consider the evidence you provide and decide whether or not the repairs required have an impact on rateable value.</p><br/><br/><p>If the VOA thinks that the repairs needed have a negative effect on the rateable value of your property, they may reduce the rateable value figure or even give a nil value, depending on the extent of the repair.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""inspection-of-your-property"">Inspection of your property</h2><br/><br/><p>A valuation officer may need to inspect your property and you should let the VOA know of any health and safety arrangements, if applicable.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""if-you-disagree-with-the-voas-decision"">If you disagree with the VOA’s decision</h2><br/><br/><p>If you disagree with the valuation officer’s decision, you can make a challenge through the VOA’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates"">online service</a> if your property is in England. For properties in Wales, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-rates-proposal-to-alter-the-2017-rating-list"">complete a proposal form</a> and send it to the VOA.</p><br/><br/><p>If you decide to make a challenge, you should provide as much evidence as possible of why you think your rateable value is wrong.</p><br/><br/><p>The VOA will discuss the case with you and if you can’t reach an agreement, you can contact the  <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/rating.aspx"">Valuation Tribunal</a> to make an appeal.</p><br/></div></p>",

There are six <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rules"">GIRs</abbr>, which are set out in Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 1 directs that:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>A heading code is a four digit code, while a chapter code is a two digit code, (the first two of the heading code). The terms of the heading descriptions - and the notes to each section and chapter - are paramount when it comes to classifying goods correctly.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 6 determines how goods are classified at the level of a subheading code - a code with six or more digits. So if an item is classified using a code of six or more digits both <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 6 and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 1 will always apply.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3 and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 4 sometimes also apply depending on the nature of the goods to be classified. It’s important to note that you must consider each <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> in sequence. For example, you cannot use <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c to classify goods until you have tried using <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2a, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2b, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3a and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3b.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 5 applies to certain types of container and to packing materials presented with the items they’re designed to package. </p><br/><br/><p>Guidance notes on interpreting each <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> are included in the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Notes"">HSENs</abbr>) to the Tariff.

To correctly classify composite goods like this, try to establish which device performs the main function. Then you can classify the whole item under the heading code for the device that performs this main function.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s not possible to establish which device in a composite item performs the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c. According to this rule, of all the possible heading or subheading codes that could equally apply, the code that comes last in numerical order is used to classify the goods.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying composite goods.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""multifunctional-goods"">Multifunctional goods</h3><br/><br/><p>Multifunctional goods are items that are designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions. For example, a clock radio tells the time and receives radio signals.</p><br/><br/><p>To classify a multifunctional item correctly, try to establish its main function. If this is possible, classify the item under the heading or subheading code appropriate to that function as if that were the item’s only function.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s not possible to establish which the main function is, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c as outlined above.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying multifunctional goods.</p><br/><br/><p>Individual components that work together to perform a single function some items consist of a series of individual components that are intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the heading codes in chapter 85. The components can be separate or connected by any means like cables or wireless devices.</p><br/><br/><p>If an item matches this description, then the whole item is classified under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function it performs.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 4 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying single function goods made up of several components.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""some-useful-definitions"">Some useful definitions</h2><br/><br/><p>Definitions of some of the terms used in this guide - and in chapter 85 of the Tariff - are listed below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>external power source - a power source like mains electricity that does not come from within an item’s own casing - a vehicle’s battery is an external power source</li><br/>  <li>image size ratio - or ‘aspect ratio’ -  the ratio of a television or monitor screen’s image width to its image height</li><br/>  <li>independently powered - see ‘portable’ below</li><br/>  <li>non-film cameras - these are devices like digital cameras that do not use photographic film or plates to record images</li><br/>  <li>play, player - in this guide, a sound or video player is a device that reproduces recorded or saved sound or video</li><br/>  <li>portable - in this guide, a ‘portable’ electrical appliance is one that can operate without an external power source - it might, for example, be powered by internal batteries, a built-in clockwork generator or an integral solar panel. It might be able to work with an external power source too</li><br/>  <li>radio, radio tuner and radio receiver - these terms are used interchangeably in this guide and refer to a device that can receive radio broadcasts and signals - note though that a radio tuner might not have a built-in amplifier</li><br/>  <li>video recorder, cassette recorder - common names for devices that can often both record and play back sound or video</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><p>The second annual <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-nation-2014-report"">State of the Nation Report</a> which is published and laid before Parliament today from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission (SMCP), shows that Britain is on the brink of becoming a permanently divided nation.</p><br/><br/><p>The Report says that while a strong economic recovery and a record number of people in work are welcome, the social recovery needed to get Britain back on track to abolish child poverty has not happened. Instead it predicts 2020 is set to mark the end of the first decade since records began without a fall in absolute poverty.</p><br/><br/><p>The Report warns that “2020 could mark a watershed between an era in which for decades there have been rising living standards shared by all and a future era where rising living standards by-pass the poorest in society.”</p><br/><br/><p>It warns that the link between effort and reward on which social mobility relies has been broken by changes in the housing market - with home ownership rates halving among young people in 20 years - and the labour market - with 5 million workers trapped in low pay.</p><br/><br/><p>When combined with cuts in welfare and public spending, these changes put Britain on track to become a permanently divided nation unless radical new approaches are taken by the next government to meet this 2020 challenge. It finds no political party is being honest about the impact of planned spending cuts or has sufficiently ambitious plans to tackle entrenched levels of low pay.</p><br/><br/><p>It comes to the reluctant conclusion that there is no way the government can meet the statutory target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. It calls on the next government to supplement the existing targets with new measures to give a more rounded picture of poverty and to publish a new timescale for achieving them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""the-report-advises-the-government-to-commit-to-the-following-objectives"">The report advises the government to commit to the following objectives:</h3><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-macro-economic-policy-to-recouple-economic-growth-with-earnings-growth"">For macro-economic policy, to recouple economic growth with earnings growth.</h4><br/>    <p>Closing the chasm between low income households and the rest can no longer rely on tax credits to do all the heavy lifting – employers will have to raise wages and workers will have to increase their hours. The key recommendation is that the UK should commit to becoming a Living Wage nation by 2025 at the latest.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-fiscal-policy-to-ensure-future-fiscal-consolidation-minimizes-the-impact-on-child-poverty-and-social-mobility"">For fiscal policy, to ensure future fiscal consolidation minimizes the impact on child poverty and social mobility.</h4><br/>    <p>Tough choices will have to be made but the working poor will need to be better protected.  The recommendation is that the Office of Budget Responsibility should publish an assessment of each Budget for its impact on social mobility and child poverty.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-social-policy-to-ensure-that-young-people-are-not-left-behind-as-the-labour-market-moves-ahead"">For social policy, to ensure that young people are not left behind as the labour market moves ahead.</h4><br/>    <p>Young people are losing out on jobs, wages and housing so the next government should commit to end long-term youth unemployment by 2020. The key recommendation is that half of all larger workplaces should offer quality apprenticeships.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-housing-policy-to-ensure-it-contributes-to-more-social-mobility-and-less-child-poverty"">For housing policy, to ensure it contributes to more social mobility and less child poverty.</h4><br/>    <p>This generation of young people is far less likely to progress onto the housing ladder than their parents’ generation.  The key recommendation is to create new forms of housing tenure through expanded shared ownership schemes and reform of the private rented sector.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-education-policy-to-ensure-it-closes-the-attainment-gap-between-disadvantaged-children-and-their-better-off-peers"">For education policy, to ensure it closes the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers.</h4><br/>    <p>Without a new focus the gap in attainment between the poorest children and their better-off peers will take 20 years to even halve.  The key recommendation is that the best teachers should be paid more to teach in the worst schools to help end illiteracy and innumeracy in primary school by 2025 and to halve the attainment gap in secondary school by 2020.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-universities-and-employers-to-ensure-they-recruit-from-a-broader-range-of-talent-universities-and-professions-are-poised-to-expand-dramatically-and-this-needs-to-bring-with-it-a-social-mobility-dividend"">For universities and employers, to ensure they recruit from a broader range of talent.

Some of the terms and phrases commonly used to describe stone and stone articles are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bossed-stone"">Bossed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>Bossed stone is stone that’s been given a ‘rock-faced’ finish. It’s smoothed along its edges but has rough, uneven faces.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bushed-stone"">Bushed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>Bushed stone has a surface that’s been dressed - or smoothed - using a special hammer. A bushing hammer has several rows of pyramid-shaped studs or spikes on its striking face (or faces).</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""calcareous-rock"">Calcareous rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Calcareous rock is sedimentary rock that contains a considerable amount of calcium carbonate. Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>limestone</li><br/>  <li>dolomite</li><br/>  <li>chalk</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""carding"">Carding</h3><br/><br/><p>Carding is a process used to untangle and clean fibres. It produces a continuous web or sliver of the fibre. Mineral fibres, for example, may be carded.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""corbel"">Corbel</h3><br/><br/><p>A corbel is a stone, brick or block that sticks out from a wall to support a weight above it.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""dressed-stone"">Dressed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>A stone that’s been dressed has had one or more of its surfaces smoothed.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""exfoliation"">Exfoliation</h3><br/><br/><p>Exfoliation is the removal of loose flakes, layers or scales from a piece of stone.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""flagstone"">Flagstone</h3><br/><br/><p>A flagstone is a flat, relatively thin slab of stone that’s used for paving or for covering a hole. Natural flagstones are cut from sedimentary rock that splits easily into layers. They’re often made of fine-grained sandstones.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""flocculent"">Flocculent</h3><br/><br/><p>A flocculent material is one that’s made up of cloud-like or fluffy tufts (flocs). Mineral wool could be described as flocculent, for example.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""igneous-rock"">Igneous rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Igneous rock is rock that was formed as the earth’s magma cooled and solidified. Examples include basalt and granite. It is one of the three main types of rock. The other two are sedimentary and metamorphic.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""kerbstone"">Kerbstone</h3><br/><br/><p>Kerbstones are stones that are placed edgeways along the side of a path, road or pavement.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""metamorphic-rock"">Metamorphic rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Metamorphic rock starts life as an existing rock that’s altered by environmental processes such as heat or pressure. Just about any rock can become metamorphic rock. Examples include slate and marble.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""porphyry"">Porphyry</h3><br/><br/><p>Porphyry is a general term for igneous rocks that have quite large individual crystals - usually feldspar or quartz - set in fine-grained material (‘groundmass’). An example would be granite-porphyry.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sedimentary-rock"">Sedimentary rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Sedimentary rock is formed by the accumulation of particles such as sand and shell fragments. Examples include limestone and sandstone.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sett"">Sett</h3><br/><br/><p>A sett is a small rectangular stone block, often granite. These were once used to surface roads and are now more commonly used for domestic pathways and driveways. Typical dimensions are 15 centimetres to 23 centimetres long, 7 centimetres to 10 centimetres wide and 15 centimetres deep.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""soapstone-steatite"">Soapstone (steatite)</h3><br/><br/><p>Soapstone - or steatite - is a coarse type of talc. It comes in blocks or chunks and often looks like marble. It is a soft stone that’s easy to carve, so it’s often used to make ornaments and jewellery. It can also be fired to produce a very hard material that’s often used to make electrical insulators.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""stucco"">Stucco</h3><br/><br/><p>Stucco is a smooth surfaced plaster or cement render that’s applied to external walls.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""touchstone"">Touchstone</h3><br/><br/><p>Touchstone is also known as lydian stone or lydite. It is a highly siliceous material, meaning it contains a lot of silica. It is normally black and evenly fine grained and does not splinter.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""identifying-fired-ceramics"">Identifying fired ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>Fired ceramic articles can be made of various different materials. To classify a fired ceramic item correctly, it’s important to identify the material that it’s made of.</p><br/><br/><p>Examples of different fired ceramic materials such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>common pottery</li><br/>  <li>earthenware</li><br/>  <li>stoneware</li><br/>  <li>fine pottery</li><br/>  <li>porcelain (or china)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""common-pottery"">Common pottery</h3><br/><br/><p>Common pottery is porous and has large, clearly visible impurities in it. These impurities could include, for example, sand and other aggregates or even straw. Common pottery articles usually have a natural colour such as yellow, red, grey or beige - they’re rarely white.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s easy to scratch or score common pottery articles because they’re quite soft compared with other types of ceramic. Bowl-shaped articles give a dull sound when they’re tapped.</p><br/><br/><p>Common pottery is typically used to make things such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>garden pots</li><br/>  <li>drainage pipes</li><br/>  <li>bricks</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""earthenware"">Earthenware</h3><br/><br/><p>Earthenware items are usually glazed. Earthenware is porous and has impurities, but they’re small and invisible to the naked eye. Unglazed areas are easy to scratch - they give off a powder (‘dandruff’) when they’re scored.</p><br/><br/><p>Earthenware articles usually have a natural colour like grey, red, brown, yellow, cream or off-white. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped. Bowl-shaped articles give a dull sound when they’re tapped.</p><br/><br/><p>Earthenware is often used to make things such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tableware and kitchenware</li><br/>  <li>household articles</li><br/>  <li>sanitary articles</li><br/>  <li>tiles and paving</li><br/>  <li>ornaments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for earthenware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Terracotta</li><br/>  <li>Creamware</li><br/>  <li>Cistercian</li><br/>  <li>Dolomite (not resin bound)</li><br/>  <li>Faience</li><br/>  <li>Majolica</li><br/>  <li>Moilica</li><br/>  <li>Mochaware</li><br/>  <li>Slipware</li><br/>  <li>Delftware</li><br/>  <li>Gallyware</li><br/>  <li>Galleryware</li><br/>  <li>Queensware</li><br/>  <li>Agateware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""terracotta"">Terracotta</h3><br/><br/><p>Identifying terracotta - ‘baked earth’ in Italian - can be confusing. It is a common mistake to think that any red or red-brown pottery must be terracotta, but it may not be. Most clays, including stoneware and porcelain, can be dyed or pigmented to give a terracotta colour, but they will not have the other characteristics of true terracotta.</p><br/><br/><p>True terracotta - including branded Terracotta - can usually be identified as earthenware and has the same characteristics. A laboratory test may be needed to be absolutely sure, but it can usually be identified correctly by looking closely at it, scratching it and tapping it.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""fine-pottery"">Fine pottery</h3><br/><br/><p>Fine pottery is similar to earthenware, but the colour ranges from yellow to brown - or reddish brown.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""stoneware"">Stoneware</h3><br/><br/><p>Stoneware is not porous (except under laboratory testing). Often it is not glazed, although articles like kitchenware and tableware usually do have a glaze. It is difficult to scratch and common colours include off-white, grey or blue-grey, and beige. Sometimes the clay’s dyed before it’s shaped.</p><br/><br/><p>Bowl-shaped stoneware articles give a clear sound when they’re tapped. Stoneware is commonly used to make the same sorts of things as earthenware.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for stoneware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Basalt Ware</li><br/>  <li>Cane Ware</li><br/>  <li>Crouch Ware</li><br/>  <li>Etrusian Ware</li><br/>  <li>Jasper Ware</li><br/>  <li>Oven Ware</li><br/>  <li>Salt-glazed Ware</li><br/>  <li>Yellow Ware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""dolomite"">Dolomite</h3><br/><br/><p>Dolomite is a natural mineral. It is often calcined - fired - and mixed with materials such as steatite to make things like firebricks for kilns. Sometimes it’s mixed with clay and fired to make household articles. These are similar to earthenware.</p><br/><br/><p>Dolomite and other stone can also be crushed and mixed with resins before being made into articles like house-wares and ornaments. Household items made of dolomite are almost always mixed with a material like clay or resin.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""porcelain-or-china"">Porcelain or china</h3><br/><br/><p>Porcelain - or china - includes bone china. It is non-porous and usually difficult to scratch.</p><br/><br/><p>Porcelain articles are usually white and shiny. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped. Porcelain is normally translucent when it’s held up to a light.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for porcelain articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Bone China</li><br/>  <li>Jet Enamelled Ware</li><br/>  <li>Parian Ware</li><br/>  <li>Pythagoras Ware</li><br/>  <li>Rockingham Ware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""porcelain-look-alikes"">Porcelain look-alikes</h3><br/><br/><p>Sometimes, pottery is made up to look like porcelain. ‘Imitation porcelain’ and ‘semi-porcelain’ items are glazed and decorated to resemble porcelain, but they’re quite different in other ways. For example, beneath their shiny white glaze they’re rough grained, dull and porous, and can easily be scratched with a steel knife (although some soft china can also be scratched like this). Articles like this are not classified as porcelain or china.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-functional-household-ceramics"">Classifying functional household ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>A ‘functional’ item is one that’s designed to serve a useful purpose. Functional household items are often decorated too, but the decoration does not affect their usefulness - they work just as well as similar but plain examples.</p><br/><br/><p>Some examples of functional household ceramic items include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tableware such plates, bowls and dishes</li><br/>  <li>kitchenware such as pots, pans and jugs</li><br/>  <li>toilet articles such as soap dishes</li><br/>  <li>other household items such as ashtrays</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Household ceramic articles that have a clear functional purpose are classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what they’re made of.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tableware"">Tableware</h3><br/><br/><p>Some examples of ceramic tableware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tea and coffee services and pots</li><br/>  <li>plates, dishes and trays</li><br/>  <li>tureens and bowls</li><br/>  <li>mugs and cups</li><br/>  <li>spoons</li><br/>  <li>cruets, salt cellars and sauce boats</li><br/>  <li>egg cups and teapot stands</li><br/>  <li>table mats, knife rests and serviette rings</li><br/>  <li>tiles specially designed or adapted to be used as table mats</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Functional ceramic tableware items are classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china.

If they’re made of other fired ceramics then they’re classified under heading code 6912.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""toilet-articles"">Toilet articles</h3><br/><br/><p>Examples of ceramic toilet articles - which may be intended for either domestic or non-domestic use - include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>toilet sets - ewers, bowls and similar items</li><br/>  <li>sanitary pails</li><br/>  <li>bed pans and chamber pots</li><br/>  <li>spittoons, douche cans and eye baths</li><br/>  <li>soap dishes, towel rails, toilet paper holders and toothbrush holders</li><br/>  <li>towel hooks</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Functional ceramic toilet articles also include other similar items for bathrooms, toilets and kitchens, including things designed to be fixed to a wall. They’re classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china and under heading code 6912 if they’re made of other fired ceramics.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-household-articles"">Other household articles</h3><br/><br/><p>Other functional ceramic household articles include ashtrays, matchbox holders and so on. Once again, they’re classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china and under heading code 6912 if they’re made of other fired ceramics.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-ornamental-ceramics"">Classifying ornamental ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>A ceramic article is classified as ‘ornamental’ if its usefulness is clearly less important than its decorative characteristics. For example, plates that are moulded in relief or teapots that have hollow handles are considered to be ornamental products.</p><br/><br/><p>Ornamental ceramic products are classified under heading code 6913. This heading code covers a wide range of ceramic articles used for decorating the interiors of homes, offices, churches and other buildings. It also covers outdoor products like garden ornaments.</p><br/><br/><p>Ornamental articles can also be made of unfired materials such as crushed stone mixed with resin. These are classified under heading code 3926 when the resin gives the articles their essential character.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""statues-and-other-ornaments"">Statues and other ornaments</h3><br/><br/><p>Products such as these are purely ornamental and have no practical use. They include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>statues, statuettes, busts, haut or bas reliefs, and other figures for interior or exterior decoration</li><br/>  <li>ornaments such as animals and symbolic or mythical figures designed to be put on mantelpieces and shelves. These also include ornaments that form parts of clock sets</li><br/>  <li>sporting or art trophies</li><br/>  <li>wall ornaments such as tiles, plates, trays and plaques that have fittings for hanging</li><br/>  <li>medallions</li><br/>  <li>fire screens</li><br/>  <li>artificial flowers, fruit, leaves and so on that are made in one piece</li><br/>  <li>wreaths and similar ornaments for tombs</li><br/>  <li>knick-knacks for shelves or domestic display cabinets</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""religious-ornaments"">Religious ornaments</h3><br/><br/><p>These include ceramic ornaments such as crucifixes and other church and religious ornaments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bowls-vases-and-pots"">Bowls, vases and pots</h3><br/><br/><p>These include products such as table bowls, vases, pots and jardinières that are purely ornamental.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tableware-and-domestic-articles"">Tableware and domestic articles</h3><br/><br/><p>These products are only classified under heading code 6913 if their usefulness is clearly less important than their decorative characteristics. Examples include products such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>trays moulded in relief, which makes them nearly useless</li><br/>  <li>ornaments incorporating an incidental tray or container that can be used as a trinket dish or ashtray</li><br/>  <li>miniatures that do not have any genuine usefulness</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, tableware and domestic utensils are generally designed to be useful. In most cases, any decoration is secondary and does not restrict their usefulness. So if a decorated ceramic household product can be used just as effectively as a plain item, it’s considered to be functional and not ornamental. Functional items are classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what they’re made of.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-ornamental-items"">Other ornamental items</h3><br/><br/><p>These include ceramic articles - other than tableware and domestic utensils - that are used for interior decoration, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>smokers’ sets</li><br/>  <li>jewel cases, cachou boxes and cigarette boxes</li><br/>  <li>perfume burners</li><br/>  <li>ink stands</li><br/>  <li>book-ends</li><br/>  <li>paperweights and similar desktop items</li><br/>  <li>picture frames</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ceramic cornices, friezes and similar architectural ornaments are not classified under heading code 6913, even though they may have ornamental characteristics. They’re classified under heading code 6905 instead.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-tiles-and-building-products"">Classifying tiles and building products</h2><br/><br/><p>Tiles and building products are covered in Chapter 68 and Chapter 69. Individual products are classified according to the materials they’re made of and whether or not they’ve been fired or glazed.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""ceramic-tiles"">Ceramic tiles</h3><br/><br/><p>Ceramic tiles are generally classified under heading code 6907.

The following items are also excluded from Chapter 68:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>when the artificial stone contains resin and stone and the resin gives the essential character then they would be classified as plastics and covered in Chapter 39</li><br/>  <li>minerals in their raw state, for example unworked soapstone, are covered in Chapter 25</li><br/>  <li>slate pencils and slate drawing boards are covered in Chapter 96</li><br/>  <li>lithographic stones are covered in Chapter 84 under heading code 8442</li><br/>  <li>dental burrs are classified in Chapter 90 under heading code 9018</li><br/>  <li>worked items made of mineral carving materials such as amber, meerschaum and jet are covered in Chapter 96 under heading code 9602</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""hints-and-tips"">Hints and tips</h3><br/><br/><p>Chapter 68 and Chapter 69 cover between them articles made of ceramics and natural minerals. Fired ceramics are covered in Chapter 69, while unfired ceramics, natural stone and some artificial stone articles are covered in Chapter 68.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""materials-that-may-be-fired-or-unfired"">Materials that may be fired or unfired</h3><br/><br/><p>Some materials are used both in a fired and an unfired state to make certain articles. Sometimes, their uses are different depending on whether they have been fired or not.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, soapstone or steatite - is soft and is commonly carved into ornaments such as statuettes. These might be fired, in which case they’re covered in Chapter 69, or unfired, in which case they’re covered in Chapter 68. Fired soapstone is also used for making electrical insulators, but these are covered in Chapter 85 as electrical equipment.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""soapstone-jewellery"">Soapstone jewellery</h3><br/><br/><p>Soapstone is considered to be a ‘semi-precious’ stone, but it’s normally excluded from heading code 7103 (precious and semi-precious stones) by guidance in the Harmonised System Explanatory Note (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Note"">HSEN</abbr>) to Chapter 71 (Note B on page XIV-7103-2). You can buy <abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Note"">HSENs</abbr> on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.wcoomd.org/"">World Customs Organisation website</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>Soapstone jewellery is classified under heading code 7116, while raw and unworked soapstone is covered in Chapter 25 under heading code 2526.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""artificial-stone"">Artificial stone</h3><br/><br/><p>‘Artificial stone’ is commonly made from crushed natural stone or other minerals mixed in with a poly resin binder. It is often moulded to make articles such as statuettes. Resin-bound artificial stone is classified according to whether the resin gives the articles their essential character. When the resin does not give the essential character then it is classified as an artificial of stone in Chapter 68. But if the resin gives articles their essential character then it is classified as a plastic article in Chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""glazes"">Glazes</h3><br/><br/><p>When classifying fired ceramics it often makes a difference whether they’re glazed or not. Glazed ceramics are usually smooth and shiny, while unglazed ceramics are generally duller and rougher.</p><br/><br/><p>‘Glazing’ includes methods of finishing fired ceramics using enamels, special glazes and so on that are covered in Chapter 32 under heading code 3207. It also includes salt glazing. This involves putting sodium chloride (salt) into the kiln during firing, where it ‘volatilises’ (evaporates) and the vapour reacts with the clay to form a glaze.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""functional-or-ornamental"">Functional or ornamental</h3><br/><br/><p>It is often necessary to decide whether a ceramic article is mainly functional or mainly ornamental (non-functional) to be able to classify it correctly.</p><br/><br/><p>Some items, such as bricks and bathroom fixtures, are obviously functional, so there’s no requirement to classify them according to whether they’re functional or ornamental - they have their own subheading codes. Other items are obviously only ornamental. A statuette, for example, serves no purpose other than decoration, so it’s classified as an ornamental ceramic item under heading code 6913.</p><br/><br/><p>However, some items - particularly house-wares - can be either functional or ornamental, often depending on their particular design. For example, a plate could be functional, but it could also be intended mainly for decoration.</p><br/><br/><p>To decide whether a ceramic article is mainly functional or mainly ornamental, consider whether a decorated version would work just as well as a plain undecorated one. If it would, then the decoration’s less important than the function and so it’s classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what it’s made of.

There is no need to give personal details, and information that leads directly to an arrest could be considered for a small reward.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan, 61, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested at a swimming pool in Valencia on 10 August by the Guardia Civil. He fled the UK 12 years ago after being found guilty of smuggling 28.3 million cigarettes into the country. His crimes robbed the UK of around £4 million in duty and he was sentenced in his absence in December 2001.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan was part of a wider conspiracy to smuggle around 56 million cigarettes into the UK between November 1999 and March 2000. Ten other men were involved in the plot, which robbed the UK taxpayer of over £8.2 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Adrian Farley, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">McGowan is finally facing UK justice after 12 years on the run.

The upper does not include the tongue or any padding around the collar.</p><br/><br/><p>If the upper is made of more than one material then you have to decide which material covers the greatest external area. You should ignore any accessories and reinforcements like:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ankle patches</li><br/>  <li>edging</li><br/>  <li>ornamentation</li><br/>  <li>buckles, tabs, eyelet stays and similar attachments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""the-outer-sole"">The outer sole</h3><br/><br/><p>The outer sole is the part of a shoe, boot, slipper or other item of footwear that comes into contact with the ground during use. The outer sole does not include any separate attached heel.</p><br/><br/><p>To establish what the outer sole is made of you have to identify the material that has the greatest surface area in contact with the ground. You should ignore any accessories and add-ons such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>spikes</li><br/>  <li>bars</li><br/>  <li>nails</li><br/>  <li>protectors and similar attachments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""reinforcements"">Reinforcements</h3><br/><br/><p>Reinforcements are parts such as leather or plastic patches that are attached to the outside of the upper to give it extra strength. They may or may not be attached to the sole. To be treated as a reinforcement an attached part must cover material that’s suitable for use as an upper, not just lining material. If an attached part covers just a small area of lining material it’s treated as part of the upper and not as a reinforcement.</p><br/><br/><p>So that you can be sure of classifying footwear correctly it might be necessary for you to cut the external material to see what’s underneath it and find out which parts are reinforcements and which parts make up the real upper.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-useful-definitions"">Other useful definitions</h3><br/><br/><p>When you’re classifying footwear it’s useful to know what the other parts of a boot or shoe are called.</p><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/968/Footwear_guide3.gif"" alt=""Diagram: parts of a trainer""></div></figure><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>collar - the area that forms the rim of a boot’s or shoe’s upper</li><br/>  <li>eyelet - the reinforcement around the edge of a lace hole, usually made of metal or plastic</li><br/>  <li>eye stay - the area of a shoe or boot on which the eyelets are located</li><br/>  <li>foxing - a thin strip, often made of rubber, attached round the edge of some shoes and boots</li><br/>  <li>heel counter - a patch of material attached to the outside of the heel area of a boot’s or shoe’s upper to stiffen it</li><br/>  <li>heel tab - a patch of material attached to the outside of the heel area of a boot’s or shoe’s upper beneath the collar</li><br/>  <li>toe cap - a patch of material used to reinforce the outside of the toe area of the upper </li><br/>  <li>tongue - a flap of upper material attached to the vamp that covers the instep of the wearer - the tongue typically lies between and beneath the two eye stays</li><br/>  <li>vamp - the part of the upper behind the toe cap - the vamp can include the toe if the shoe or boot has no toe cap </li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""types-of-footwear"">Types of footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>When you classify footwear it’s important to identify what type of footwear it is and any particular purpose it might have.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes the upper is the part of the shoe that covers the sides and top of the foot.</p><br/><br/><p>Some of the more common types of footwear covered in chapter 64 are listed below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>clogs - usually the uppers are made in one piece and are fixed to the soles by rivets; sometimes clogs are made in a single piece and do not have - or need - a separate, applied outer sole, in which case they’re classified according to the material they’re made from and not covered in this chapter</li><br/>  <li>espadrilles - these are also called beach shoes and have plaited fibre soles that are no thicker than 2.5 centimetres; they do not have heels</li><br/>  <li>flip-flops - these are also referred to as thongs; the thongs - or straps - are fixed by plugs that lock into holes in the sole</li><br/>  <li>hiking or walking boots - note that these are not classified as sports footwear</li><br/>  <li>Indian sandals - these have leather outer soles and leather uppers. The upper consists of straps that cross the instep and go around the big toe</li><br/>  <li>moccasins (American Indian type) - these use a single piece of material, traditionally soft leather, to form both the sole and the upper (or part of the upper); this makes it difficult to identify where the outer sole finishes and the upper begins</li><br/>  <li>neoprene footwear - this is typically used in diving and water sports; if the neoprene upper is covered or laminated with textile on both sides, then it’s classified as being made of textile; if the upper has no textile covering, or it’s covered only on one side, then it’s classified as being made of rubber</li><br/>  <li>safety footwear - footwear in which the toe caps are made of metal</li><br/>  <li>sandals - the front part of the upper (the vamp) consists either of straps or of material with one or more pieces cut out of it</li><br/>  <li>shoes - this term covers footwear, including trainers, that are not described elsewhere in this guide</li><br/>  <li>slippers - these include mules as well as other indoor footwear such as ballet slippers and ballroom dancing shoes; if the outer sole is made of plastic or rubber (approximately 1 centimetre thick) and then covered by a very thin, insubstantial layer of textile material, the slippers are classified as having ‘plastic/rubber’ outer soles; in some cases, all or part of the plastic or rubber outer sole is covered with a thicker, more durable textile material which is dotted with polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>) (this is to prevent the wearer from slipping) - these slippers are classified according to the material that has the most contact with the ground. If the slipper has a plastic or rubber sole that’s covered with a textile covering, the slipper can only be classified under heading code 6405 if the textile is proved to be durable. The durability of the textile can be proven by submitting the shoe for a martindale abrasion test and tested at 51,000 revolutions </li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>When you classify footwear there are some specific things that you need to think about.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""male-or-female-footwear"">Male or female footwear?</h3><br/><br/><p>Sometimes it’s difficult to determine whether the footwear is meant for men or women. It helps to think about the size, shape or style of the footwear. Remember that unisex footwear cannot be identified as either men’s or women’s footwear.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sizing"">Sizing</h3><br/><br/><p>Chapter 64 does not distinguish between adults or children’s footwear because adults can have small feet and children can have large feet. Instead, footwear is classified according to its size, specifically whether the length of the insole is more or less than 24 centimetres. Products that are identified depending on the length of the inside insole are classified under heading codes 6402 and 6403.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sports-footwear"">Sports footwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Some types of footwear are classified as sports footwear. This covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>footwear that has been designed for a sporting activity - it must have, or be able to have, features attached like spikes, sprigs, stops, clips or bars</li><br/>  <li>skating boots, ski boots, snowboard boots and cross-country ski footwear, snow boots, wrestling or boxing boots and cycling shoes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Trainers are not classified as sports footwear unless they’re training shoes as specifically mentioned under heading code 6404 11.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""common-materials-used-to-make-footwear"">Common materials used to make footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>Products covered in this chapter can be made of any material except asbestos, which is classified in heading code 6812. Examples of materials commonly used in footwear include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>rubber</li><br/>  <li>plastics</li><br/>  <li>leather, composition leather and fur skin</li><br/>  <li>textiles - including felt and non-wovens</li><br/>  <li>plaiting materials</li><br/>  <li>wood</li><br/>  <li>cork</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Rubber and plastics include woven fabrics and other textiles with a visible external layer of one of these materials.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""plastic-sheeting"">Plastic sheeting</h3><br/><br/><p>This is any flat material made of plastics covered in chapter 39. It may be shaped by gluing, sewing, welding or moulding (vacuum forming).</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""cellular-plastic-sheeting"">Cellular plastic sheeting</h3><br/><br/><p>This is a type of plastic with many cells throughout the material. Cells can be open, closed or a mix. It’s commonly used in manufacturing footwear classified under heading code 6402. It’s often used as a substitute for leather and described as ‘imitation leather’, ‘synthetic leather’, ‘PU (polyurethane) leather’, ‘vinyl leather’ or ‘<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr> leather’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""textile-material"">Textile material</h3><br/><p>This is any flat material made of woven or knitted textile fibres. Textile fibres include plastic strips less than 5 millimetres wide.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""artificial-straw-and-other-plaiting-materials"">Artificial straw and other plaiting materials</h3><br/><p>These materials are classified as textiles if they’re made of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>materials classified under heading code 5308 - yarn of other vegetable textile fibres, paper yarn</li><br/>  <li>materials classified under heading code 5404 - synthetic monofilament of 67 decitex or more and of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1 millimetre, strip and the like (for example artificial straw) of synthetic textile materials of an apparent width not exceeding 5 millimetres</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Footwear made of materials normally classified under heading code 5404 is classified under heading code 6404. But if the width of the fibres or strips is more than 1 millimetre (for synthetic monofilament) or more than 5 millimetres (for strip and the like) then the material is treated as ‘other material’ and the footwear is classified under heading code 6405.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""neoprene"">Neoprene</h3><br/><p>Neoprene is a cellular rubber with many cells throughout the material. Cells can be open, closed or a mix. It’s normally covered on at least one side by knitted textile fabric. Water sports footwear is often made from neoprene.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""leather-composition-leather-and-patent-leather"">Leather, composition leather and patent leather</h3><br/><p>Leather is the hide or skin of animals such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>cows and other bovine species</li><br/>  <li>goats and kids</li><br/>  <li>sheep and lambs - without their wool</li><br/>  <li>swine</li><br/>  <li>reptiles like snakes and crocodiles</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Animals used for leather must not be on the endangered species list. To check, contact the <abbr title=""Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora"">CITES</abbr> helpline on 0117 372 8749.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent leather is leather coated with a varnish, lacquer or pre-formed plastic sheet. It has a shiny, mirror-like surface. The varnish or lacquer used can be pigmented or non-pigmented and may be based on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>vegetable oil that dries and hardens - linseed oil is normally used</li><br/>  <li>cellulose derivatives like nitro-cellulose</li><br/>  <li>synthetic products (including thermoplastics) - polyurethane plastics are normally used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If pre-formed plastic sheet is used to coat leather it’s usually made from polyurethane or <abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>.</p><br/><br/><p>The surface of patent leather is not necessarily smooth. It could be embossed - maybe to imitate crocodile skin - or artificially crushed, crinkled or grained. But it must still have a shiny, mirror-like finish.</p><br/><br/><p>To be classified as patent leather the thickness of the coating must not be more than 0.15 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather coated with pigmented paint or lacquer to give a metallic sheen. These paints and lacquers consist of pigments like mica, silica and similar flakes in a binding substance like vegetable oil that dries and hardens, or plastic. Leather treated like this is known as ‘imitation metallised leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent laminated leather is leather coated with a sheet of pre-formed plastic thicker than 0.15 millimetres but less than half the total thickness of the finished material. It has the same mirror-like finish as patent leather and is sometimes known as ‘patent coated leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather coated with metal powder or leaf - for example silver, gold or aluminium.</p><br/><br/><p>If leather is covered by a sheet of pre-formed plastic thicker than 0.15 millimetres, but more than half the total thickness of the finished material, then it’s covered in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""identifying-the-main-materials-used-in-footwear"">Identifying the main materials used in footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>When you’re identifying the correct commodity code for certain items of footwear, the first step is to establish the main material from which the upper is made.</p><br/><br/><p>The shoes in both the examples below are made from a combination of textile, leather and lining material. Only textile and leather are viable uppers for classification purposes. At first glance, the main material of the shoes in both examples seems easy to identify, but further examination reveals that this is not necessarily the case.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""shoe-apparently-made-mostly-of-textile"">Shoe apparently made mostly of textile</h3><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/967/Footwear_guide2.gif"" alt=""Diagram: a shoe apparently made mostly of textile""></div></figure><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather toe cap (1) and the leather toe vamp (2) reveals that there’s only insubstantial lining material underneath. This means that both these leather sections have to be considered as viable uppers.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather sections (3), (4), (5) and (6) reveals that there’s only lining material underneath. This shows that the textile upper material is not one continuous piece. Instead a number of individual sections of textile have been sewn onto the lining material and leather has been used to cover the areas of lining material where the pieces of textile do not meet. This means that all of the leather sections must be considered as viable uppers.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather side section (7) reveals that the textile material does not continue all the way down to the sole area. This side section also has to be considered as a viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The small leather section on the side of the shoe (8) is used for reinforcement and has textile, not lining material, underneath it. This means that the textile, and not the small leather section, is the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>Similarly, removing the logo (9) reveals textile, not lining material, underneath it. This means that the textile, and not the logo, is the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The examination has revealed that a greater area of the upper is made from leather than from textile. So in this example the shoe will be classified under heading code 6403.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""shoe-apparently-made-mostly-of-leather"">Shoe apparently made mostly of leather</h3><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/966/Footwear_guide4.gif"" alt=""Diagram: a shoe apparently made mostly of leather""></div></figure><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather toe cap (1) and the leather toe vamp (2) reveals that there’s textile material underneath. This means that the textile must be considered as the viable upper and the toe cap and the vamp are just reinforcements.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather eye stay (3) reveals a large area of lining material and a small area of textile (marked A on the diagram) underneath. Because the textile does not extend all the way under the leather eye stay section - and because lining material is not substantial enough to be considered as a viable upper - the leather section must be considered as the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather section (4) reveals that it’s sewn on top of textile and that it also overlaps a small section (marked as A) of the leather eye stay (3). The leather eye stay has already been taken into account as a viable upper so the overlapping piece of the leather section cannot be counted. As there’s textile underneath the rest of the leather section, textile must be considered as the viable upper, and the whole of the leather section is treated as reinforcement.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing leather sections (5) and (7) and the logo (8) reveals textile underneath. This means that the textile is considered as the viable upper and the leather sections and logo are treated as reinforcements.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather heel counter (6) reveals an area made up of textile and lining material. Because the textile does not extend all the way underneath the heel counter, the leather is considered as the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The examination has revealed that a greater area of the upper is made from textile than from leather. So in this example the shoe will be classified under heading code 6404.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""footwear-parts-and-accessories"">Footwear parts and accessories</h2><br/><br/><p>Footwear parts are classified under heading code 6406. They can be made out of any material except asbestos, which is classified in chapter 68 under heading code 6812.</p><br/><br/><p>Footwear parts classified under heading code 6406 include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>parts of uppers, like toe caps and vamps, that are not attached to an outer sole. They can be stitched, glued or attached in some other way to an inner or middle sole, or insole</li><br/>  <li>pieces of leather that have been cut approximately to the shape of an upper</li><br/>  <li>stiffeners - these are pieces of hard material like plastic that are inserted into a shoe or boot between the heel or toe section and its reinforcement or lining; they’re designed to give these areas greater strength and rigidity</li><br/>  <li>inner and middle soles, and outer soles with no other shoe parts attached to them; if an outer sole does have another shoe part attached, it’s treated as a complete item of footwear and classified according to the material from which the outer sole and shoe part are made</li><br/>  <li>arch supports and insoles</li><br/>  <li>heels - these can be any type and made of any material; they could be designed to be glued, nailed, or screwed on. Heel parts, like top pieces, are also included</li><br/>  <li>studs, spikes and other similar items for sports footwear</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Two or more footwear parts assembled together are also classified under heading code 6406 as long as they do not essentially form a completed item of footwear. This is the case whether they’re attached to an inner sole or not.</p><br/><br/><p>Fittings that can be worn inside footwear are also classified as footwear parts under heading code 6406.

a chemically defined substance, a chemically defined group of substances, such as alkaloids, polyphenols or anthocyanins, or a plant extract - active substances must have medicinal properties to prevent or treat specific diseases and ailments, or their symptoms</li><br/>  <li>excipient - a non-nutritional substance (like magnesium stearate) added during the production of tablets</li><br/>  <li>herbal medicinal preparations - these are preparations based on one or more active substances, these are obtained from a plant, or parts of a plant, by a process such as drying, crushing, extraction or purification</li><br/>  <li>homeopathic medicinal preparations - these are prepared from products, substances or compositions called ‘homeopathic stocks’ or ‘mother tinctures’, these mother tinctures are diluted - for example in alcohol or water, the degree of dilution must be shown (for example D6)</li><br/>  <li>Provitamin</li><br/>  <li>Recommended Daily Allowance (<abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr>)</li><br/>  <li>vitamins or mineral preparations - these are preparations based on vitamins that are covered under heading code 2936, or based on minerals, including trace elements, and mixtures of minerals, they’re used to treat or prevent specific diseases or ailments, or their symptoms - this type of preparation contains a much higher amount of vitamins or minerals, generally at least 3 times higher than the <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-miscellaneous-food-preparations"">Classifying miscellaneous food preparations</h2><br/><br/><p>Products that do not treat, cure or prevent diseases or ailments are generally classified under heading code 2106 as food preparations not elsewhere specified or included.</p><br/><br/><p>Many items are classified under this heading code, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>mixtures of plants, or parts of plants, with other ingredients, like plant extracts, but these mixtures are not consumed in this form, and are used to make herbal teas and infusions, they may have a particular purpose, for example to be used as a laxative, purgative or diuretic, or to relieve flatulence, but others claim to provide relief from ailments or to promote general health or well-being</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of ginseng extract with other ingredients to make ginseng tea or drink</li><br/>  <li>food or dietary supplements that are based on substances like plant extracts, fruit concentrates, honey or fructose and that contain added vitamins, but the packaging of these preparations often indicates that they’re beneficial in maintaining general health or well-being</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Although many products like vitamins are usually classified under this heading, it’s important to take into account:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the actual contents of the product</li><br/>  <li>how the product is made up, presented or labelled</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These may mean that a product is classified under a different heading. For example, vitamins that are mixed with water and other ingredients and are ready for immediate consumption as drinks or tonics are not covered under heading code 2106. Instead they’re covered in chapter 22.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-tonics-and-liquid-food-supplements"">Classifying tonics and liquid food supplements</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 22 covers tonics and liquid food supplements that are meant for immediate consumption. These preparations contain added vitamins or iron compounds and are designed to maintain general health or well-being. This type of product is generally covered under one of the following heading codes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>heading code 2202 - non-alcoholic beverages</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2205 - aromatised wines</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2206 - mixtures of fermented beverages, mixtures of fermented beverages with non-alcoholic beverages and other fermented beverages</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2208 - spirituous beverages, this includes products like tonic wine fortified with herbal extracts or vitamins, and liquid herbal remedies with a basis of distilled alcohol - these are included under this heading even if they’re meant to be taken in very small quantities</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-provitamins-and-vitamins-chapter-29"">Classifying provitamins and vitamins (chapter 29)</h2><br/><br/><p>Separately defined organic compounds, like vitamins, are covered in chapter 29. To be covered in this chapter they must comply with strict conditions that specify the additives that are allowed.</p><br/><br/><p>These compounds can be dissolved in water or in some other solvent, but the solution must be used only because it’s required for safety reasons or for transport purposes. Stabilisers, such as anti-caking agents, can also be added, but only to preserve the compound or for transport purposes.</p><br/><br/><p>For example an essential trace element like chromium picolinate is prepared as a dietary supplement in the form of tablets or capsules, it would not be covered in this chapter. This is because the added ingredients, like binder, the capsule shell and excipients, have not been added just for the purposes of preservation or transport.</p><br/><br/><p>This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading 2936 specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>provitamins</li><br/>  <li>vitamins</li><br/>  <li>derivatives used mainly as vitamins</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of provitamins, vitamins and vitamin derivatives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Certain specified additives, such as antioxidants, are allowed provided that the amount added is just enough for the vitamins to be preserved or transported.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes it’s very important that anything added to a compound does not make the resulting product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if vitamins are prepared as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules or caplets then they’re not classified under heading code 2936. Because of the way they’re presented, with an intended daily dosage, they’re considered to be suitable for a specific use.</p><br/><br/><p>They’re also excluded from this heading code because the purpose of the additives is for more than just preserving or transporting the vitamins. The additives are there to give the product a convenient and easy to use form.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-herbal-medicinal-preparations"">Classifying herbal medicinal preparations</h2><br/><br/><p>Herbal medicinal preparations, or medicaments, are covered in chapter 30 under heading codes 3003 and 3004. These include preparations used (either internally or externally) to treat or prevent human or animal diseases or ailments. Products that maintain general health and well-being are specifically excluded from this chapter.</p><br/><br/><p>If a medicinal preparation is made up into measured doses, like ampoules, syringes or capsules, then these must be classified under heading code 3004.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code also specifically covers the retail sale of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>herbal and homoeopathic medicinal preparations</li><br/>  <li>certain preparations containing vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids or fatty acids</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products must include certain information for consumers on their labels or packaging, or on the accompanying user directions. This information must show:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the specific diseases, ailments or deficiencies (or their symptoms) for which the product is to be used</li><br/>  <li>the concentration of the active substances that the product is based on</li><br/>  <li>the dosage</li><br/>  <li>mode of application</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The level of vitamins and minerals in these products must be much higher than the <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> of these substances for just maintaining general health or well-being.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-29"">Specific exclusions from chapter 29</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading code 2936 covers provitamins and vitamins, to which certain permitted substances can be added, for example stabilisers. The following products are specifically excluded from this heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that are particularly suitable for specific use, for example vitamins that are made up as food supplements in the form of capsules, tablets, caplets and so on which have a recommended daily dosage. These are considered to be suitable for specific use and so are covered elsewhere.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain more ingredients than just the additives that are permitted for preserving or transporting the compound, for example, vitamins that have been mixed with other organic chemicals, minerals, herbs, other parts of plants, food ingredients and similar substances.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""animal-feed-supplements"">Animal feed supplements</h3><br/><br/><p>Feed supplements for animals that contain vitamins and other ingredients, such as cereals and proteins are covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309. This heading code specifically excludes vitamins that just have permitted substances such as stabilisers added to them and which are meant for general rather than specific use. These are covered in chapter 29 under heading code 2936.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""recommended-daily-allowance-rda"">Recommended Daily Allowance (<abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr>)</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""rda-for-vitamins""><br/><abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> for vitamins</h3><br/><br/><p>An <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> is set for certain vitamins and minerals.

If your (or another person’s) entitlement to act as legal personal representative is based on intestacy you will need to prove your (or their) relationship by supplying the birth and marriage certificates which prove you (or they) are that person’s personal representative.   You will also need to confirm the dates of death of anyone entitled to act as a personal representative when you submit a claim (see Order of priority to share to an intestate estate above) as well as supplying copies of search results for a grant to the estate concerned which can be obtained from <a rel=""external"" href=""https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills"">Find a will</a></p><br/><br/><p>For example, if you are a nephew of someone whose estate has been dealt with by BVD but your father (the deceased’s brother) survived the deceased but has since died then it is your father’s estate that is entitled to claim and share in the deceased’s estate. Any claim to the deceased’s estate would have to be made by your father’s personal representative (see ‘Definition of a personal representative’ above).   If your father left a valid will, his personal representative will be the person named on the grant of probate to the will or, if probate was not granted, the executor of the will.</p><br/><br/><p>If your father did not leave a will, it will be the person named on the grant of letters of administration to his estate or the person entitled to deal with his intestate estate (see ‘Order of priority to share in an intestate estate’ above).</p><br/><br/><p>You would only be entitled to claim the deceased’s estate if you are your father’s personal representative.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, if your father died without leaving a will and there is no grant of letters of administration to his estate and he was married at the time of his death, it will be his spouse who will be his personal representative. If she has since died then it will be her legal personal representative who will be entitled to make a claim to the deceased’s estate (and her personal representative will be determined in the same way as set out in the ‘Definition of a personal representative section).   If you are in any doubt about your entitlement to claim the estate, you should either seek your own legal advice or send a family tree, including the dates of death of family members on it, to:</p><br/><div class=""contact "" id=""contact_3097""><br/>  <div class=""content""><br/>    <h3>BVD - Estates</h3><br/><br/>    <div class=""vcard contact-inner""><br/><br/>        <div class=""email-url-number""><br/>            <p class=""email""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Email</span><br/>              <a class=""email"" href=""mailto:bvestates@governmentlegal.gov.uk"">bvestates@governmentlegal.gov.uk</a><br/>            </p><br/>        </div><br/><br/><br/>    </div><br/>  </div><br/></div><br/><br/><p>You can check whether a grant of Probate or Letters of Administration has been issued using the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills"">probate search service</a> and obtain court sealed copies of these by making a postal application to the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance/searching-for-probate-records"">Probate Registry</a></p><br/><br/><h2 id=""illegitimacy"">Illegitimacy</h2><br/><br/><p>Illegitimacy (when a child is born to parents who were not married at the time of his or her birth and they did not subsequently marry) as a bar to intestate succession was removed by the Family Law Reform Act 1987.  This means illegitimacy is irrelevant if someone dies on or after 4 April 1988 and their estate can be claimed by those relatives defined by the Administration of Estates Act 1925 whether they were illegitimate or not.</p><br/><br/><p>If a deceased person died intestate before 4 April 1988 and was illegitimate, the only persons who are entitled to share in their estate before the Crown are their spouse, children (or their descendants) and parents.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""adoptions"">Adoptions</h2><br/><br/><p>Only adoptions made by Court Order under the Adoption Act (or foreign adoptions recognised by English law) have any legal effect for the purposes of succession.  Such an adopted person becomes, for the purposes of succession, the child of his or her adoptive parents and ceases to have any interest in his or her natural family.  Legal adoptions have been possible only since 1 January 1927.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""time-limits-for-claiming-estates-administered-by-bvd"">Time limits for claiming Estates Administered by BVD</h2><br/><br/><p>Claims will be accepted by BVD within, generally, 12 years from the date that the administration of the estate was completed and interest will be paid on the money held.</p><br/><br/><p>However, BVD will admit fully documented claims up to 30 years from the date of death, subject to no interest being paid on the money held, if the claim is received after the 12 year period above has run out.</p><br/><br/><p>Fully documented claims (including documents of ID and personal representative documents) must be received within 30 years of the date of death.  If BVD receives a claim whether fully documented or not, outside the 30 year time limit it will not be considered.  If an incomplete claim is received, you must supply the documents required to complete the claim within the 30 year time limit or the claim will not be considered.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""genealogists"">Genealogists</h2><br/><br/><p>Genealogists are private companies who trace potentially entitled relatives for commercial gain. They do not work for, on or behalf of, BVD but often make enquiries for relatives after BVD advertises an estate.   You do not have to use a genealogist’s services to make a claim to BVD if you do not wish to do so, and such a decision does not affect any entitlement you may have to share in an estate.</p><br/><br/><p>If you are contacted by a genealogist, it is up to you whether you use their services and BVD will not advise you in this respect.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""make-a-claim-to-bvd"">Make a claim to BVD</h2><br/><br/><p>BVD publishes a list of all estates which have yet to be claimed. This list is updated daily, with new estates added.   Any estates which have been claimed, or where a will has been located, or where the time limit for making  a claim has run out or the estate is insolvent are removed from the list.</p><br/><br/><p>If you believe you are entitled to claim an estate which has been dealt with by BVD, please send a family tree which shows how you are related to the person who has died, and include the dates of birth, marriage and death of all those on the tree.  If it appears that you may be entitled to claim the estate, BVD will then ask you to supply documentary evidence that proves your entitlement.</p><br/><br/><p>This will include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>full birth certificates (showing the parents’ names) and marriage certificates of each person  between you and the deceased (including yours and the deceased’s).</li><br/>  <li>identification documents which provide proof of your name and of your name linked to your address (see a <a href=""#identity-documents"">list of acceptable ID documents</a> at the end of this guide)</li><br/>  <li>a full explanation, supported by evidence, of any discrepancies in the documents supplied with your claim or about any missing documents  but you should note that these may affect the acceptance of your claim</li><br/>  <li>if you are a third party who represents a claimant you will also need to provide written confirmation that you have been instructed by the claimant to make a claim. This could be in the form of a contract signed by the claimant provided it contains a clause confirming that the claimant has instructed your firm to make a claim on their behalf, or in a separate letter of authority signed by the claimant to this effect.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>BVD may also ask you for other evidence if needed. If additional evidence includes <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/census-records/"">census returns</a> or the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/1939-register/"">1939 Register</a>, this should be a copy of the actual return not an online transcript of the information contained on the return.</p><br/><br/><p>If you are in any doubt about how to prove your claim, you should seek your own advice, from a solicitor, local law centre or the Citizen’s Advice Bureau.

BVD will generally deal with the first fully documented claim received.  If a claim that is incomplete is received first and is then followed by a fully documented claim from someone else – the fully documented claim will be dealt with.</p><br/><br/><p>If BVD receive a fully documented claim and subsequently receive a claim from a relative who is higher up the order of priority (see ‘Order of priority to share in an intestate estate’), that claim will be considered before the first claim received’</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""obtaining-documents-for-your-claim"">Obtaining documents for your claim</h2><br/><br/><p>Certificates issued in the United Kingdom can be obtained from the local registrar where the event took place or as follows:</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""england-and-wales"">England and Wales</h3><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>General Register Office<br/><br>PO Box 2<br/><br>Southport<br/><br>Merseyside<br/><br>PR8 2JD <br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further information can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.direct.gov.uk/gro"">General Register Office</a> website.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""scotland"">Scotland</h3><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>Register General<br/><br>General Registration Unit<br/><br>Room 44<br/><br>New Register House<br/><br>Edinburgh<br/><br>EH1 3YT<br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk"">Scottish General Register Office</a> website</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""northern-ireland"">Northern Ireland</h3><br/><br/><p>Before 1922:</p><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>General Register Office<br/><br>Government Offices<br/><br>Roscommon<br/><br>Republic of Ireland <br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.groireland.ie"">Republic of Ireland General Register Office</a> website.</p><br/><br/><p>After 1922:</p><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>Register General for Northern Ireland<br/><br>Oxford House<br/><br>49-55 Chichester Street<br/><br>Belfast<br/><br>BT1 4HL<br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.groni.gov.uk"">Register General for Northern Ireland</a> website.</p><br/><br/><p>BVD cannot assist you in obtaining documents or certificates from overseas and you should take your own legal advice as necessary.

The fabric used can be unbleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed. Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours.</p><br/><br/><p>Additionally if sewn-on ribbing of a different fabric is present on any of the components, the set is excluded from classification as an ensemble.</p><br/><br/><p>The packaging can take various forms and each component can be in its own packaging, but when presented to Customs, the ensemble must be presented as a single unit in a form ready for retail sale. Retail packaging includes plain poly bags, labelled retail poly bags or boxes containing one ensemble. The two parts of the set must be packaged together in their own bag. Using adhesive tape to bind two poly bags together does not qualify.

A garment that covers both the upper and lower parts of the body, such as one which falls from the shoulders down to below mid-thigh, cannot form part of an ensemble.  However, there are specific exceptions where ensembles include two upper garments, one of which is a pullover that presented together form a twinset. A lower garment must also be included. Waistcoats may form a second upper garment of an ensemble classified under chapter 61 and chapter 62.

If the whole of the front side is not one single fabric, it should be classified according to its predominant material over the whole of the glove. Some sports gloves are an exception. If their essential character is defined by a material on a different part (for example, a goalkeeper’s gloves used for ice hockey where the fabric on the back protects the hand) they should be classified under that material.</p><br/><br/><p>Some other gloves are classified elsewhere:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>gloves lined with fur skin, artificial fur or with fur skin or artificial fur on the outside other than as trimming are classified under heading codes 4303 or 4304</li><br/>  <li>gloves or mitts for babies are classified under heading codes 6111 or 6209</li><br/>  <li>friction gloves for massage or toilet use are classified under heading code 6302</li><br/>  <li>loofah friction gloves are classified under heading code 4602</li><br/>  <li>gloves, mittens and mitts made from paper, cellulose wadding or web of cellulose fibres are classified under heading code 4818</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""legwarmers"">Legwarmers</h3><br/><br/><p>These items that do not cover the feet are classified under heading code 6406.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bra-extensions"">Bra extensions</h3><br/><br/><p>These consist of a strip of textile material of about 3.5 cm wide and 7 cm in length and have hooks at one end and eyes on the other end, both of base metal. It can be attached to the backside of a bra. A bra extension does not only prolong a bra, but it mainly enables women who cannot wear universal sizes, to wear a bra. This allows a bra to fulfil its function as body support by adapting it to women who cannot use universal sizes. The bra extension is classified to heading 6217.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-specialist-clothing"">Classifying specialist clothing</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""sports-bras"">Sports bras</h3><br/><br/><p>To be correctly classified as a sports bra under heading 6212, it has to have a clear definition of cups or separation of the breasts. The separation can be in the form of clear individual cups or merely stitching or rucking/gathering of material between the breasts. The garment is designed to cover the upper part of the body and extend down to just below the bust, with a body supporting function. This garment is designed to be worn next to the skin as an undergarment.</p><br/><br/><p>If the bra consists of merely elastin around the bottom of the bra with no separation of the breasts, it would not be classified to this heading.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""nightwear"">Nightwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Men’s or boys’ pyjamas are classified under subheading codes 6107 21 00 to 6107 29 00, or 6207 21 00 to 6207 29 00 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Women’s or girls’ pyjamas are classified under subheading codes 6108 31 00 to 6108 39 00, or 6208 21 00 to 6208 29 00 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>In general terms, to be classified as pyjamas the garments must be clearly identifiable as intended exclusively or mainly as nightwear.</p><br/><br/><p>Pyjamas comprise two garments - one for the upper part of the body, generally a jacket-type garment or pullover and another for the lower part of the body, usually trousers or shorts of a simple cut. The components must be of corresponding or compatible size and of matching cut, constituent fabric, colours, decorations and degree of finish to show clearly that they are designed to be worn together. They must be of a suitable fabric to wear at night, have a loose fitting cut and not have any potentially uncomfortable features such as large or bulky buttons nor excessive applied decorations.</p><br/><br/><p>Pyjama trousers when presented without an upper garment, and Chinese style satin pyjamas, cannot be classified as nightwear. Sets of knitted garments comprising a pair of shorts and a T-shirt-style upper are not classified as pyjamas. However, sets of garments known as ‘baby dolls’, comprising a very short nightdress and matching briefs, can be classified as pyjamas.</p><br/><br/><p>Nightdresses are defined as being:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>between less than knee length to ankle length</li><br/>  <li>made from either light or heavy fabric</li><br/>  <li>garments made from light fabrics may be elaborately decorated with lace ribbons, piping, gathers, bows or embroidery</li><br/>  <li>those made from heavier fabrics are generally more simply styled but may be brushed and/or printed and have some decoration</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>They cannot be classified as nightdresses if the garments have:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>linings</li><br/>  <li>fastening cords or ribbons with decorative attachments (for example, of metal) that would make them unsuitable for wearing in bed</li><br/>  <li>ribbons, laces or cords for tying at the back of the neck</li><br/>  <li>excessive elastication at the top of the garment or substantial gathering at the waist that would make it uncomfortable to wear in bed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Lightweight loose fitting long T-shirt style garments and those that have any features that would make them uncomfortable or unsuitable to wear in bed, whether they look like nightdresses or not, cannot be classified as such, even if they’re decorated with night-time themes.</p><br/><br/><p>One-piece nightwear that covers both the upper and lower body and envelops each leg separately are covered later in the chapter - heading codes 6107 91 to 6107 99, or 6207 91 to 6207 99 for men’s or boys’, headings codes 6108 91 to 6108 99, or 6208 91 to 6208 99 for women’s or girls’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""industrial-and-occupational-clothing"">Industrial and occupational clothing</h3><br/><br/><p>Industrial and occupational clothing - items worn solely or mainly to provide protection (physical or health) and made from tough or non-shrink fabric - is usually classified under chapter 62.</p><br/><br/><p>Usually these types of clothing do not feature decoration, other than perhaps marks or indications of the intended purpose of the clothing. Usually made from cotton, synthetic or artificial fibres or a mixture of these textiles, they feature safety seams or double seams to increase their strength and are often fastened with press studs, zips, Velcro strips or crossed or knotted closure using laces or similar items.</p><br/><br/><p>Pockets are generally stitched on and slit pockets are usually made of the same fabric as the garment.</p><br/><br/><p>Only garments of a commercial size of 158 (having a body height of 158 centimetres) or more can be considered industrial or occupational garments. Uniforms and official garments (such as judges’ gowns or church vestments) are not considered industrial or occupational garments.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical industrial occupational clothing, such as boiler suits or coveralls, is used by mechanics, factory workers, bricklayers, farmers, etc. It also includes aprons and dust coats for doctors, nurses, charwomen, hairdressers, bakers and butchers.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""babies-garments-and-clothing-accessories"">Babies’ garments and clothing accessories</h3><br/><br/><p>Babies’ garments are classified under heading codes 6111 and 6209 as appropriate. They must be intended for infants of a body height not more than 86 centimetres (commercial size 86). This applies even if features such as the method of fastening would, for identical garments above commercial size 86, require classification as boys’ or girls’ garments.</p><br/><br/><p>Layette articles - garments clearly designed for newborn babies - should always be classified under these headings, regardless of their dimensions. For example, christening robes and gowns, capes, pixie suits or babies’ booties without applied soles.</p><br/><br/><p>Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 651/2007, sleeping bags with sleeves or armholes designed for children or adults (ie over 86 centimetres) are excluded from 6111 or 6209 and classified under codes covering ‘other garments’ under 6114 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>There are specific and detailed measurements that define the maximum sizes of many garment types for them to fall into commercial size 86 centimetres.</p><br/><br/><h4

All chest measurements are taken from armholes with the garment in its relaxed (unstretched) position.<br/>2. Measurements 22 and 23 are taken inside the garment when quilted or padded.<br/>3. Where a garment is fitted with adjustable straps, the straps should be positioned either on the buttonhole giving the shortest adjustment, or with a moveable buckle or clasp positioned 8cm from the unattached end of the strap.<br/>4. Measurements 10 and 15 are taken to a fixed leg end, ie lengths should not exceed those specified to allow for unfixed roll-up or turned up.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""track-suits-and-ski-suits"">Track suits and ski suits</h3><br/><br/><p>Track suits are defined by the general appearance and nature of their fabric and the fact they are clearly meant to be worn exclusively or mainly for sporting activities. They are classified under heading codes 6112 or 6211 as appropriate. Bear in mind however that there are different criteria for knitted and woven track suits.</p><br/><br/><p>Track suits comprise two garments:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>A garment to cover the upper part of the body down to, or slightly below, the waist. This garment:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>has long sleeves with ribbed or elasticised bands, zip fasteners or other tightening elements at the cuffs</li><br/>      <li>has similar tightening elements, also including drawstrings, are usually found at the bottom of the garment</li><br/>      <li>is with or without an opening or have a complete or partial opening at the front</li><br/>      <li>if a complete opening at the front, the fastening system must be a zip, press studs or velcro</li><br/>      <li>if the opening is partial, it may in some circumstances be fastened with any type of buttons</li><br/>      <li>may be fitted with a hood, collar or pockets</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/>  <li>A garment - a pair of trousers - which will be:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>either close or loose fitting</li><br/>      <li>with or without pockets</li><br/>      <li>with an elasticated waistband, drawstring or other means of tightening at the waist</li><br/>      <li>with no opening at the waist and therefore no buttons or other fastening systems</li><br/>      <li>with or without foot straps.</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>The trousers may also be fitted with ribbed or elasticated bands, slide fasteners (zippers) or other tightening elements at the bottom of trouser legs which generally go to ankle level.</p><br/><br/><p>Knitted tracksuits must not be lined, but the inner surface of the fabric may be raised (napped).</p><br/><br/><p>Woven tracksuits may be lined. Components of a tracksuit made up with an outer shell of a single identical fabric should be classified under one heading under heading code 6211. Sets of garments such as shell suits whose components are made up in separate fabrics - even if the only difference is colour - must be separately classified as upper and lower parts under heading code 6211.</p><br/><br/><p>Ski suits, defined as garments or sets of garments that, given their appearance and fabric, are clearly intended to be worn principally for cross country or alpine skiing, are classified under heading codes 6112 and 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>They comprise either:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>A ski overall - a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and lower parts of the body. In addition to sleeves and collars, they may also include pockets or footstraps.</li><br/>  <li>A ski ensemble - a set of garments made up of two or three pieces and put up together for retail sale that includes one garment such as an anorak, windcheater, wind jacket or similar, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly also including a waistcoat and a pair of trousers, breeches or a bib and brace overall.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>The ski ensemble may also consist of the overall described above with a type of padded, sleeveless jacket.</p><br/><br/><p>All the components of a ski ensemble must be made up of the same texture, style and composition and be of corresponding or compatible size. They can however be of different colours.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""swimwear"">Swimwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Swimwear is defined as garments that, given their general appearance, cut and nature of fabric, are recognisably intended to be worn solely or mainly as swimwear. They’re generally made of man-made fibres and are classified under heading codes 6112 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts must have inner briefs sewn to the garment or a least a lining in the front of the crotch and be tight at the waist, such as having a drawstring or fully elasticated waist.</p><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts may have pockets, provided that:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the outside pockets have a firm fastening system to close the pocket completely, such as a zip or velcro</li><br/>  <li>the inside pockets are fixed to the waist and have an overlap closing system that must assure complete closure of the pocket opening</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts cannot have a front opening or opening at the waist, even if closed with a closing system.</p><br/><br/><p>Unless all these conditions are met, the garments must be classified as shorts under heading codes 6103, 6104, 6203 or 6204.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""asian-garments-and-turbans"">Asian garments and turbans</h3><br/><br/><p>Saris are designed to be worn draped around the body from the shoulder to the ankles. They cover part of the upper body and the whole of the lower body. They are made from woven fabric and are classified under heading code 6211 if they meet the criteria stated below. They’re worn with a choli, or blouse, which covers the shoulders and the bust, and a waist petticoat.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris are rectangular pieces of woven fabric approximately 4.5 to 5.5m in length and 122 centimetres wide. They’re made from lightweight fabrics of silk, cotton or man-made fibres but are not made of wool. They have two selvedges running along the length of the fabric. In order to be classified as a garment, at least one of the two shorter edges must be finished off by hemming, fringing, drawn thread work or any other method specified in Note 7 to Section XI of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris with two selvedges and two raw ends are classified as fabric in the piece even though they may be wearable in this form.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris may be made in any colour, plain or with any form of decoration or pattern including embroidery, hand printing or embellishments of gold and silver thread.</p><br/><br/><p>The methods of manufacture and appearance of the principle types of saris entering into international trade are:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>Silk saris made on a hand loom with a contrasting border along one edge of the length of the fabric. In some cases, the end design to be worn across the shoulder also has a contrasting border and knotted fringe, while the remaining two sides may be decorated, frequently to a lesser degree. These articles are usually made individually and are mainly imported from India.</li><br/>  <li>Machine-made artificial silk saris of rayon. These are often embellished with yarns of different colours to imitate embroidery and may be finished by fringing or drawn thread work.</li><br/>  <li>Machine-made, continuous fibre, polyester and georgette saris. Usually patterned all over, these are made in the length, cut to size and hemmed at both ends. They are imported mainly from Hong Kong and Japan.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>Occasionally a sari is approximately one metre longer than the standard length. This additional piece of material may be detached by the wearer and used to make the choli, or blouse, referred to above.</p><br/><br/><p>The point of division between the sari proper and the additional piece is made obvious by a line of drawn thread work across the width of the fabric or by a change in the pattern. Such ‘composite’ articles are classified as saris providing at least one of the shorter ends is made up within the terms of Note 7 to Section XI of the Tariff.  In other cases, they are to be classified as fabric in the piece.</p><br/><br/><p>Other products (for example, shawls) that are imported in a similar condition are classified as ‘made-up’ articles (for example, as shawls under heading code 6214) or piece goods according to these criteria.</p><br/><br/><p>The choli is a short top, which does not reach the waist. It is usually classified as an ‘other garment’ under heading 6114 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Kurta salwar or shalwar kameez are not usually classified as suits or ensembles. A kameez is a garment designed to cover the body from the shoulders to the knee, although in some cases this garment may be slightly shorter. It’s usually classified as a dress under heading codes 6104 or 6204 as appropriate.

guide</h2><br/><br/><p>Textiles fabrics that are not finished clothing or clothing accessory items are covered in chapter 50 to chapter 60 and arranged by type of textile.</p><br/><br/><p>Other made up articles of textile such as table or bed linen are classified under chapter 63.</p><br/><br/><p>Items for fancy dress that are not made of textiles are mostly classified under chapter 95.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""hints-and-tips"">Hints and tips</h3><br/><br/><p>As with many commodities, the greater your depth of knowledge about the goods, the easier it is to correctly classify them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""know-your-fabrics"">Know your fabrics</h3><br/><br/><p>The Tariff makes a significant distinction between garments that are knitted and crocheted and garments that are not. The former are classified under chapter 61, while the latter are classified under chapter 62.</p><br/><br/><p>If you’re not sure of the fabric with which your goods are manufactured, then it’s a good idea to check with your supplier before you attempt to import them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sexing-garments"">Sexing garments</h3><br/><br/><p>Throughout chapter 61 and chapter 62, garments with a left over right closure at the front are regarded as men’s or boys’ garments and those with right over left closure at the front as women’s and girls’ garments, unless the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one sex or the other.</p><br/><br/><p>Where garments cannot be identified as for either sex, they must be classified in the headings covering women’s or girls’ garments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""follow-fashions"">Follow fashions</h3><br/><br/><p>The definitions of many garments are very precise and a change in fashions may in turn lead to a change in classification. For example if your new line of T-shirts has a collar, you would need to classify it as a pullover instead.</p><br/><br/><p>When specifications and features of garments change, it’s essential to check that they do not have to be classified somewhere different than you’re used to.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""getting-groups-right"">Getting groups right</h3><br/><br/><p>The classification rules for suits and ensembles are precise and detailed. You cannot classify something as a suit or an ensemble unless precise criteria are used. One particular requirement is that the upper and lower garments must be made entirely from one type of fabric, ie no panels of different colours or construction. There are also detailed rules on how they must be presented at customs to qualify as an ensemble.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/></div></p>",

Where a benefit is attendance at an event that is not open to the public, the value of the benefit is the cost of the event divided by the number of guests.</p><br/><br/><p>You can claim Gift Aid on the donation if the value of the benefit doesn’t exceed certain limits, for example:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donation</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefit</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£101 - £1000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>These rules still apply when the benefit is given to a family member or a company run by the donor.</p><br/><br/><p>The benefit rules apply to different types of donation, like <a href=""#charity-auctions"">charity auctions</a> and <a href=""#charity-events"">charity events</a> and may affect the amount you can claim.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>You must keep a record of Gift Aid donations you receive and all benefits that were given to donors as a consequence of their donation.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><h2 id=""when-gift-aid-cant-be-claimed"">When Gift Aid can’t be claimed</h2><br/><br/><p>You can’t claim Gift Aid on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>payments for goods and services</li><br/>  <li>donations of money from a company</li><br/>  <li>gifts made on behalf of other people, for example, a <a href=""#membership-subscription"">membership subscription</a> paid on behalf of somebody else</li><br/>  <li>gifts that come with a condition about repayment</li><br/>  <li>gifts that come with a condition that the charity buys goods or services from the donor</li><br/>  <li>payments received in return for goods or services for example  <a href=""#admission-to-a-concert"">admission to a concert</a> or a fee for a sponsored challenge</li><br/>  <li>a ‘minimum donation’ where there is no choice about payment</li><br/>  <li>gifts made using ‘charity vouchers’ or ‘charity cheques’</li><br/>  <li>donations received before the date that <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> accepts your organisation as a <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> or a charity for tax purposes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""sponsored-challenges"">Sponsored challenges</h2><br/><br/><p>If your charity organises fundraising events such as marathons or treks abroad, you may be able to claim Gift Aid on sponsorship that participants raise.</p><br/><br/><p>All sponsorship payments are eligible for Gift Aid if participants pay the cost of flights and accommodation themselves.</p><br/><br/><p>Example:</p><br/><br/><p>A donor signs up for a sponsored bike ride in Vietnam which costs £1,500 for flights and support costs. The charity asks the donor to raise £2,500, of which £1,000 goes to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>Where sponsorship payments are eligible for Gift Aid, sponsors must make a valid <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/gift-aid-declarations-claiming-tax-back-on-donations"">Gift Aid declaration</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>The deposit or registration fee that participants are asked to pay in advance of a sponsored challenge is not eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If a sponsor is connected to the participant, their donations only qualify for Gift Aid if the participant pays the full cost of the trip so that all the sponsorship money raised goes to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>A ‘connected person’ is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>a wife, husband or civil partner</li><br/>  <li>a brother, sister, parent or grandchild</li><br/>  <li>the wife, husband or civil partner of a relative</li><br/>  <li>a company under the control of the donor, or under control of connected persons</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> recognises that a charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> cannot be expected to check whether a participant and their sponsors are connected. But you should take reasonable steps to ensure that Gift Aid payments are not received from people or companies connected to a participant. You can do this by including an explanation in any event literature and on the sponsorship form.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""membership-subscription"">Charity membership fees</h2><br/><br/><p>To qualify for Gift Aid, charity subscription payments must be for membership only. They must not give members personal use of the charity’s facilities or services.</p><br/><br/><p>These conditions still allow members to:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>receive newsletters you produce to explain your charity’s work</li><br/>  <li>visit and view the work of your charity</li><br/>  <li>take part in activities that form part of your charity’s objectives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""community amateur sports clubs"">CASCs</abbr> can’t claim Gift Aid on membership payments because members are given personal access to the club’s facilities or services.</p><br/><br/><p>Charity and <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr> membership fees do not qualify for the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/claiming-a-top-up-payment-on-small-charitable-donations"">Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme (GASDS)</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>Gift Aid can’t be claimed on a subscription payment paid on behalf of someone else. This is because it’s considered a gift to the person whose membership is paid, not to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>However, if the membership of a charity is paid for a child (under the age of 18), payment is accepted as a gift and is eligible.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""professional-organisation-membership-fees"">Professional organisation membership fees</h2><br/><br/><p>Membership subscriptions paid to some professional organisations on <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/professional-bodies-approved-for-tax-relief-list-3"">list of qualifying bodies</a> can be treated as an expense deduction. Working members can claim tax relief on their subscription, but subscriptions can’t be treated as Gift Aid payments.</p><br/><br/><p>Retired or student members’ subscription fees can be treated as a Gift Aid payment, but they must confirm that they don’t have income from which they can deduct professional membership subscriptions.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""church-collections"">Church collections</h2><br/><br/><p>You can’t claim Gift Aid on donations collected in your church that will be passed directly to another charity. This is because the money collected is not part of the church’s income.</p><br/><br/><p>If a church chooses to set up a fund to raise money for a charity, then the money collected forms part of the church’s income. In this case, the church (which is a charity in its own right) must claim any Gift Aid due.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""selling-donated-goods-on-behalf-of-individuals"">Selling donated goods on behalf of individuals</h2><br/><br/><p>This process is exclusive to charity shops that operate a retail Gift Aid scheme to sell goods on behalf of donors. To maximise the amount that is raised, charities can sell valuable or collectable items donated to a shop at a commercial public auction or an online auction website.</p><br/><br/><p>Money raised by selling donated goods like clothes does not qualify for Gift Aid. You need to explain to owners of donated items that the shop, auction or website will act as their ‘agent’ to sell goods on their behalf if the owner will give the sale proceeds (minus any commission charged) to the charity as Gift Aid donation.</p><br/><br/><p>If you operate a charity shop, staff and volunteers must explain the arrangements before donors complete a form appointing you as their agent.</p><br/><br/><p>The owner has the right to keep all of the proceeds from the sale of their goods. They can choose to donate all or part of the amount. You can claim Gift Aid on the agreed amount after any commission (including VAT) has been deducted.</p><br/><br/><p>The owners of donated goods will usually make a Gift Aid declaration when they ‘sign up’ for the scheme, before their goods are sold.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""operating-retail-gift-aid"">Operating Retail Gift Aid</h3><br/><br/><p>There are 3 ways of operating ‘Retail Gift Aid’:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the Standard Method</li><br/>  <li>Method A</li><br/>  <li>Method B</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If shops are operated by the charity directly, then the charity can use the Standard Method or Method A. Charity shops that are run by a trading subsidiary company of a charity can use Method B. If shops are operated by a separate entity such as a company, then any method can be used.</p><br/><br/><p>The Standard Method allows an individual to take goods to a charity shop and agree that the shop will act as their agent in selling the goods (the shop will deduct a commission). The individual must fill in a Gift Aid declaration at this stage, if the charity does not already hold one from the individual. The charity marks the goods in some way so that the sales proceeds can be linked back to the donor.</p><br/><br/><p>After the goods are sold (but before the charity makes a Gift Aid claim) the charity shop writes to the owner of the goods to advise them of the net sale proceeds. <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr> provides template letters for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-claim-template-letter-standard-method"">the Standard Method</a>, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-the-end-of-year-method-a"">Method A</a> and <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-the-end-of-year-method-b"">Method B</a> for you to download, print and use.</p><br/><br/><p>Other template letters are available for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Method A for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-when-100-limit-is-exceeded-method-a"">where the £100 limit has been exceeded</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>Method A <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-sales-above-the-100-limit-method-a"">where subsequent sales are made after the £100 limit has been exceeded</a><br/></li><br/>  <li>Method B for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gift-aid-template-letter-for-sales-above-the-1000-limit-method-b"">sales above the £1,000 limit</a><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The charity shop must give the individual at least 21 days to respond to this letter before it treats the net sale proceeds as a donation to the charity.</p><br/><br/><p>How each method works is explained in more detail in <abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>’s detailed guidance on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-detailed-guidance-notes/chapter-3-gift-aid#chapter-342-claiming-gift-aid-when-goods-are-sold-by-and-the-proceeds-gifted-to-charities"">Retail Gift Aid</a>. If you want to claim Gift Aid in this way, you must read the guidance to make sure you meet the conditions of the scheme.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""keeping-records"">Keeping records</h3><br/><br/><p>You must keep all documentation related to claims on the proceeds from the sale of goods on behalf of individuals, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the donor’s dated Gift Aid declaration</li><br/>  <li>a copy of any written agreement with the donor that shows the charity or its subsidiary can sell goods on their behalf</li><br/>  <li>documentation to show that the individual has been notified of sale proceeds where required</li><br/>  <li>accounting records to prove that items belong to an individual</li><br/>  <li>if the goods are sold by a trading subsidiary, records to show how the sales proceeds are sent to you</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Charities are advised to maintain records of staff and volunteer training and guidance, to prove that they’re implementing the process correctly.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""charity-events"">Charity events</h2><br/><p id=""charity-events"">If you sell tickets to an event you’ve organised, eg a concert or fundraising dinner, payment does not qualify for Gift Aid. Even if the ticket price is higher than the cost of the event, the money made from ticket sales counts as profit and not a donation.</p><br/><br/><p id=""admission-to-a-concert"">To qualify for Gift Aid, a payment must be a voluntary donation and not be a compulsory payment for attending an event.</p><br/><br/><p>Minimum donation payments don’t qualify for Gift Aid. But if someone chooses to pay more than the minimum donation, the extra amount paid qualifies for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If you set a ticket price for an event and also ask for a suggested donation, the donation is eligible. You must make it clear to people buying a ticket that they can attend without making a donation, but you mustn’t give preference to those who do give a donation.</p><br/><br/><p>If you arrange a ‘donation only’ event where people can attend whatever they decide to give (including making no donation), then all donations would qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""viewing-charity-property"">Viewing charity property</h2><br/><br/><p>Entry fees to visit and view your charity property don’t qualify for Gift Aid because they are not a gift. But a voluntary donation that allows visitors to view your property may qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations qualify when they:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>are 10% or more than the normal admission fee, or</li><br/>  <li>allow admission for at least 12 months</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>You must offer visitors a choice to pay the normal entry fee only or the admission price plus a donation at the time of entry.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><h3 id=""information-you-must-provide-to-visitors"">Information you must provide to visitors</h3><br/><br/><p>Visitors must receive the same right of admission whether or not they pay a donation.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll need to clearly advertise their normal entry fee and make it clear to all visitors that they will be allowed entry when they pay the lower admission charge if they choose not to make an additional 10% voluntary donation.</p><br/><br/><p>You can explain the choice to pay the standard entry fee or the 10% or more donation amount on your admission signage and website. The options should be explained by staff or volunteers at the time of asking for payment.</p><br/><br/><p>If you don’t give visitors a clear choice to pay the standard entry fee or make a donation of 10% or more, then any payment that exceeds the standard entry fee by 10% or more is not a freely-given gift. In this case, payment would not be eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""when-visitors-pay"">When visitors pay</h3><br/><br/><p>When a visitor voluntarily agrees to pay a donation of 10% or more, you must ask the donor:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>is the donation for entry by members of the donor’s family only</li><br/>  <li>for a written or verbal Gift Aid declaration</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If the visitor gives you a verbal declaration, you must give them written confirmation and keep a record for yourself. This is usually included as part of the payment receipt issued with entry tickets, eg on the till receipt.</p><br/><br/><p>For visitors who choose admission for at least 12 months, you have 2 options:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>accept a donation and allow free admission for all visits during the period (minus up to five days a year when free entry doesn’t apply)</li><br/>  <li>accept a donation and grant a right of admission on payment of a reduced fee, which must apply to all visits during the period (only the initial donation qualifies)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""terms-and-conditions"">Terms and conditions</h3><br/><br/><p>A voluntary donation that allows visitors to view your property will not qualify for Gift Aid if the terms and conditions attached to an admission fee include a right to a full or partial refund of the payment. For example, in the event of bad weather, cancellation of an exhibition or mechanical failure of an exhibit.</p><br/><br/><p>This is because under the Gift Aid scheme a donation cannot be repaid under any circumstances.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""expenses-paid-to-volunteers"">Expenses paid to volunteers</h2><br/><br/><p>If the expenses are reasonable, you can reimburse a volunteer for costs they have had to pay because of their work, eg, train fares.</p><br/><br/><p>Once you pay a volunteer, they can keep the money or pay part or all of it back to the charity as a Gift Aid payment.</p><br/><br/><p>Gift Aid only applies when the volunteer makes an actual payment of money to your charity or <abbr title=""community amateur sports club"">CASC</abbr>. You can’t claim Gift Aid if a volunteer decides not to claim for expenses that they’re entitled to.</p><br/><br/><p>If you pay expenses to a volunteer which are higher than the costs incurred, the payment may be taxable as employment income if it can be shown that they’re employed. If this can’t be proven, the payments may be chargeable as a miscellaneous receipt.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""charity-auctions"">Charity auctions</h2><br/><br/><p>When the retail value of an item bought in a charity auctions exceeds the benefit limits, Gift Aid can’t be claimed.</p><br/><br/><p>It is possible for the donor’s payment to be split between an amount to ‘buy’ the item and an amount that can be treated as a gift. To do this the value of the item auctioned is subtracted from the amount paid. The remainder is treated as a donation that can qualify for Gift Aid. You must make the value of the item clear to bidders at the auction before each item is sold.</p><br/><br/><p>For an item that’s not commercially available, supporters at a charity auction may pay more than its retail price to increase their donation or because the item is unique. The commercial value of a football shirt, for example, is increased if it’s signed by the football team. The benefit for Gift Aid purposes is the amount it fetches in the auction.</p><br/><br/><p>The benefit is calculated as follows:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donations</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefit</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£101 - £1000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><h3 id=""when-the-donation-exceeds-the-benefit-limits"">When the donation exceeds the benefit limits</h3><br/><br/><p>When the value of the benefit exceeds the limits in the donor benefit rules, the donor can ‘buy the benefit’.</p><br/><br/><p>For the donor to ‘buy the benefit’, and enable you to claim Gift Aid, you must make them aware of the retail cost of the item (the value of the benefit) and that they can buy the item elsewhere when they make their successful bid (donation).</p><br/><br/><p>This ‘excess donation’ qualifies for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>In some cases, supporters can bid on services that donors promise to carry out for successful bidders, like a massage or childcare. To be eligible, the amount that the successful bidder pays for the ‘promise’ is the same as the value of the benefit. If a ‘promise’ is commercially available, the value of the benefit is the same as its retail price.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""donations-to-schools-charities-involved-in-running-schools-and-educational-trusts"">Donations to schools, charities involved in running schools and Educational Trusts</h2><br/><br/><p>Only voluntary gifts or payments are eligible for Gift Aid, simply describing a payment as ‘voluntary’ or a ‘donation’ does not make it eligible for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><p>If access to educational services or facilities provided by a school requires a payment to be made by parents or relatives of students, payments are not ‘voluntary’ and therefore they are not charitable donations.</p><br/><br/><p>If parents or relatives are asked to make payments of ‘voluntary contributions’ to a school or school charity, which are linked to the provision of services or facilities to related pupils, they are not charitable donations.</p><br/><br/><p>Payments made for tuition fees, school holidays, extra-curricular activities, lessons, educational trips, or tickets for a school production are not eligible for Gift Aid. This is because these payment are not voluntary gifts, and a student receives a benefit paid for by a relative.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations made to an appeal or for a specific charitable purpose of the school, may be eligible for Gift Aid. Donations must not be linked to the provision of any benefit to a student related to a donor.</p><br/><br/><p>Donations given for non-uniform days, sponsored events, building appeals and equipment appeals will usually qualify for Gift Aid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""educational-school-trips"">Educational school trips</h3><br/><br/><p>Head teachers may not charge parents for any school trip that is part of the national curriculum. However, the head teacher may ask for a voluntary contribution towards a trip. The children of parents who do not contribute must not be discriminated against.</p><br/><br/><p>Voluntary contributions are eligible if:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>they’re non refundable even if the trip doesn’t go ahead or if their child does not go on the trip</li><br/>  <li>any benefit (for example, travel costs, trip insurance, cost of entry) does not exceed maximum levels of allowable benefit for the donation</li><br/>  <li>the school tells parents that the contribution is not compulsory</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Example 1:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution requested by school</th><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution actually made</th><br/>      <th>Amount eligible for Gift Aid</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£10</td><br/>      <td>£15</td><br/>      <td>£5</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>Example 2:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Cost of trip to a museum</th><br/>      <th>Voluntary contribution requested by school</th><br/>      <th>Amount eligible for Gift Aid</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£8 (transport £5, entry £2 and brochure £1)</td><br/>      <td>£10</td><br/>      <td>£0</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>In this case, the amount doesn’t qualify for Gift Aid because the benefit of £8 (80%) exceeds the 25% limit on benefits because:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Donations</th><br/>      <th>Maximum value of benefits</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>up to £100</td><br/>      <td>25% of the donation</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£100 to £1,000</td><br/>      <td>£25</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>£1,001 and over</td><br/>      <td>5% of the donation (up to £2,500)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/></div></p>",

Here are 4 examples.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""active-substance"">Active substance</h3><br/><br/><p>A chemically defined substance, a chemically defined group of substances, such as alkaloids, polyphenols or anthocyanins, or a plant extract. Active substances must have medicinal properties to prevent or treat specific diseases and ailments, or their symptoms.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""comparators"">Comparators</h3><br/><br/><p>Drugs that are used in trials that compare new drugs with previously available ones. They contain active substances and are defined as medicinal preparations.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""medicinal-preparations"">Medicinal preparations</h3><br/><br/><p>Preparations based on one or more active substances that have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. In other words, that cure, treat or prevent diseases or ailments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""placebos"">Placebos</h3><br/><br/><p>Products that do not contain active substances and so are not defined as medicinal preparations.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-placebos-with-food-ingredients"">Classifying placebos with food ingredients</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances and so, for the most part, they’re not classified in Chapter 30 as medicinal preparations. Instead they’re classified according to their contents.</p><br/><br/><p>If they contain food substances, or ingredients with nutritional value, no matter how little, then they’re covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106. This heading code covers ‘food preparations not elsewhere specified or included’ and would include, for example, tablets that contain a mix of food substances like sugar and starch. They could either be the only ingredients or they could be mixed with chemical items too.</p><br/><br/><p>There is an exception - placebos that are in the form of intravenous solutions that have a nutritional effect are classified in Chapter 30.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-placebos-with-chemical-ingredients"">Classifying placebos with chemical ingredients</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances, so they cannot be classified in Chapter 30 as medicinal preparations. They are classified according to their contents.</p><br/><br/><p>They often contain a mixture of chemical ingredients covered in Chapter 38 under heading 3824.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code covers ‘products of the chemical or allied industries (including those consisting of mixtures of natural products), not elsewhere specified or included’. For example this heading code would cover tablets made up of mixtures of chemical products.</p><br/><br/><p>If any of the ingredients is a food substance, or a substance with nutritional value, then the product cannot be classified in Chapter 38. Instead it’s covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""medicinal-preparations-of-placebos-and-comparators-used-for-clinical-trials"">Medicinal preparations of placebos and comparators used for clinical trials</h2><br/><br/><p>Comparator drugs contain active substances and are defined as medicaments - or medicinal preparations. These are preparations used (either internally or externally) to treat or prevent human or animal diseases or ailments. They’re covered in Chapter 30 under heading codes 3003 and 3004, depending on how they’re supplied. They must have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be classified under either heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>Medicaments that are neither made up into measured doses, nor packaged for retail sale are covered under heading code 3003.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading code 3004 specifically covers medicaments that are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>made up into measured doses - such as tablets, ampoules, syringes and capsules</li><br/>  <li>packaged for retail sale</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>It also covers placebos that are packaged together with medicinal preparations for retail sale - even though placebos are mainly covered in other chapters. This is because the active substances in the medicament part of the combined product (or set) satisfies the requirement that it should have a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""intravenous-solutions"">Intravenous solutions</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos that are in the form of intravenous solutions which have a nutritional effect are also included in Chapter 30, either under heading code 3003 or 3004, depending on how they’re presented.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""exclusions-and-difficult-classifications"">Exclusions and difficult classifications</h2><br/><br/><p>Placebos and comparators are classified in different chapters of the Trade Tariff, depending on their intended use, their ingredients and how they’re made up.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain active substances intended to treat, cure or prevent diseases and ailments are defined as medicaments and are covered in Chapter 30. Products that are made up of chemical ingredients are covered in Chapter 38. There are specific exclusions from each of these chapters.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-30"">Specific exclusions from Chapter 30</h3><br/><br/><p>To be covered in Chapter 30 a product must contain active substances and prevent, cure or treat diseases and ailments. Placebos do not contain these active substances and so, with a few exceptions, are classified elsewhere.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-38"">Specific exclusions from Chapter 38</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos that are made up from a mixture of chemical ingredients are covered in Chapter 38 under heading code 3824. If any of the ingredients is considered to be food, or has any nutritional value, then the product is excluded from this heading code and covered in Chapter 21 under heading code 2106.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""nature-of-the-product"">Nature of the product</h3><br/><br/><p>Placebos and comparators are used in clinical trials to test how effective an alternative drug is, or to compare a new drug with an existing one.</p><br/><br/><p>An important difference between placebos and comparators is whether or not they contain active substances that would define them as medicaments. Medicaments, or medicinal preparations, are products that are meant for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>therapeutic uses - they treat or cure a disease or ailment</li><br/>  <li>prophylactic uses - they prevent a disease or ailment from developing</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Placebos do not contain active substances and so they’re likely to be covered in Chapter 21 or Chapter 38, depending on their ingredients. Products that do have therapeutic or prophylactic uses are covered in Chapter 30.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""get-help"">Get help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

The majority of these commodities are covered in chapter 72 and chapter 73 of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide covers iron and steel products including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>iron and steel</li><br/>  <li>primary materials</li><br/>  <li>iron and non-alloy steel</li><br/>  <li>stainless steel</li><br/>  <li>alloy steel</li><br/>  <li>flat products</li><br/>  <li>long products, for example tubes, pipes, bars and rods</li><br/>  <li>ingots and semi-finished products</li><br/>  <li>specific finished products made from iron or steel</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If you wish to classify finished products use chapter 73, which contains detailed descriptions and classification codes.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying finished products you must carefully consider their function and application along with the composition of the metal as it’ll have an impact on finding the correct classification.</p><br/><br/><p>If the function or use isn’t intrinsic to the item - as it would be in, for example, a nut and bolt or radiator - you may have to classify it using a classification code defined by its composition, form and manufacturing technique in chapter 72.</p><br/><br/><p>The guidance that follows shows the classification choices you’ll need to make for common raw and semi-manufactured commodities using a graphical approach for ease of reference.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s essential to have as great an understanding of the details of the composition and form of your goods as possible in order to classify them correctly. For example, if you aren’t sure if your goods are flat rolled or cold rolled, you’ll not be able to classify them accurately. Check with your suppliers if you’re unsure.</p><br/><br/><p>The early pages in this section cover essential definitions and outlines of processes that will affect classification, while the later pages show you how to classify specific types of product in an easy-to-use flowchart format.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""how-iron-and-steel-are-classified"">How iron and steel are classified</h2><br/><br/><p>Classifying iron and steel products may appear daunting - chapter 72 and chapter 73 of the Tariff are dedicated to these products and are lengthy and detailed. However, adopting a logical approach to defining the products can help effective classification.</p><br/><br/><p>Iron and steel products cover an enormous variety of commodities, from base materials, through processed and semi-finished products to finished products.</p><br/><br/><p>At the less processed end of the spectrum, this guide covers primary materials of iron and steel, stainless and alloy steel, waste and scrap iron or steel, tubes, pipes, rods and bars and semi-finished products.</p><br/><br/><p>It also covers specific and detailed finished products made from iron and steel, such as barbed wire, nails and screws, containers and boxes, sewing and knitting needles, springs, radiators and kitchen and tableware</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""key-questions"">Key questions</h3><br/><br/><p>There are three key questions you need to bear in mind when you start classifying iron and steel products:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>What are the goods made of?</li><br/>  <li>What do they do?</li><br/>  <li>How do they function?</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>In most cases answering these questions fully will lead you to the correct classification code.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, a line pipe used for oil or gas pipelines made from stainless steel is reasonably easily classified using the answers to these questions.</p><br/><br/><p>You should take care to consider all these questions as the goods’ role and function can significantly impact the classification.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if you’re trying to classify a keyring that has a wire spring ring with a fob of metal or other material that is not functional, the classification will be that of the wire ring as an article of iron or steel wire.

It includes metal carbides sintered with a metal.</p><br/><br/><p>Pig iron is the main primary product of the iron and steel industry. It’s classified under heading code 7201. To be classified under this heading code, it can be:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>alloy or non-alloy pig iron</li><br/>  <li>in the form of pigs, blocks, lumps (whether or not broken) or in the molten state (however, remember that heading code 7201 does not extend to shaped or worked articles such as rough or finished castings or tubes)</li><br/>  <li>brittle and unworkable, but this can be remedied by annealing (annealing is generally applied to cast items that are not classified under heading code 7201, although annealed primary forms (such as pigs or blocks) are classified under heading code 7201)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Spiegeleisen is classified under heading code 7201 as it is generally obtained directly from ores, despite often being referred to in normal trading as a ferro-alloy. It’s:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>used principally in steel manufacture (in the Bessemer process) to de-oxidise and recarburise the iron, and for alloying</li><br/>  <li>has a high manganese content - that is approximately 15%, but more than 6% and less than 30%</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ferro-alloys are used to add definite proportions of alloying elements to steel or pig iron in order to obtain special qualities. They’re classified under heading code 7202 if they’re in the form of pigs, blocks, lumps or similar primary forms, granules, powder form or in forms obtained by continuous casting, such as billets.</p><br/><br/><p>Ferro-alloys generally:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>contain 4% or more of the element iron and other elements</li><br/>  <li>contain less iron than in pig iron</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7202 also covers ferro-alloys previously reduced to granules or powders and made into briquettes, cylinders, thin slabs or other forms using cement or other binders, or in some cases exothermic additives.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s important to remember that heading code 7202 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ferro-uranium (heading code 2844)</li><br/>  <li>ferro-cerium and other pyrophoric (igniting spontaneously on contact with air) ferrous alloys in all forms (heading code 3606)</li><br/>  <li>products that in some countries are sometimes known as ferro-nickels or ferro-nickel chromes, and that are malleable and not normally used as ‘addition materials’ in iron and steel metallurgy (heading codes 7218 to 7229 or chapter 75)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ferrous products obtained by direct reduction of iron ore and other spongy ferrous products are classified under heading code 7203. Iron and steel products of this heading are produced by reducing the ore without fusion - known as direct reduction. They’re obtained from ore in lumps, granules, or from concentrated ore in briquette or pellet form and contain more than 80% by weight of metallic iron. They also have a spongy structure (sponge iron) and can be used in the production of steel.</p><br/><br/><p>In Tariff classification terms, when in briquettes or pellet form they shouldn’t be confused with those consisting of concentrated ores under heading code 2601 (the former differ from the latter by the shiny appearance of their cut surface).</p><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7203 also covers very pure iron having an impurity content not exceeding 0.06% but it excludes steel wool, which is classified under heading code 7323.</p><br/><br/><p>Ferrous waste and scrap are classified under heading code 7204. They’re generally used for the recovery of metal by remelting or for the manufacture of chemicals. Waste and scrap are a result of the manufacture or mechanical workings of metals, and metal goods definitely not usable due to breakage, cutting up, wear or other reasons. They take the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>crop ends, filings and turnings (from the manufacture or mechanical working of iron or steel)</li><br/>  <li>shearing or flame-cutting of heavy and long pieces</li><br/>  <li>compression into bales (particularly in the case of light scrap, using for example, a hydraulic press)</li><br/>  <li>fragmentation/shredding of vehicle bodies</li><br/>  <li>crushing and agglomeration into briquettes of iron and steel filings and turnings</li><br/>  <li>breaking up of old iron articles</li><br/>  <li>remelting scrap ingots such as products roughly cast in the form of ingots without feeder-heads or hot tops, or pigs having obvious surface faults and not complying with the chemical composition of pig iron, spiegeleisen, or ferro-alloys</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Granules (of pig iron, spiegeleisen, iron or steel) are classified under heading code 7205. Granules are products of which less than 90% by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 1 millimetre and of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 5 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>Granules remain under heading code 7205 whether or not they’ve been graded by size.</p><br/><br/><p>Granules include shot (more or less round in shape) and angular grits. Shots and grit are used for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>cleaning up and de-scaling</li><br/>  <li>surface hardening (shot peeling) metal</li><br/>  <li>polishing or engraving metal or glass</li><br/>  <li>working stone or like material</li><br/>  <li>sometimes adding to concrete as a hardener (or to increase its impermeability to X-rays or gamma rays)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Heading code 7205 also covers wire pellets, produced by cutting iron or steel wire.</p><br/><br/><p>Powders (of pig iron, spiegeleisen, iron or steel) are also classified under heading code 7205. Powders are products of which 90% or more by weight passes through a sieve with a mesh aperture of 1 millimetre. They’re suitable for compacting or agglomeration.</p><br/><br/><p>These powders (including sponge iron powder) can be sintered into various items such as electromagnetic coils in telephony or magnetos, and used in the manufacture of welding electrodes and welding powders, reducing agents and pharmaceutical products.</p><br/><br/><p>Bear in mind that heading code 7205 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>radioactive iron powder (isotopes) (heading code 2844)</li><br/>  <li>iron powders presented as medicaments (heading codes 3003 or 3004)</li><br/>  <li>granules and powders of ferro-alloys (heading code 7202)</li><br/>  <li>waste filings and turnings of iron or steel (heading code 7204)</li><br/>  <li>small defective ball bearings, these aren’t considered to be shot as they have a more regular and finished appearance and are made of better quality steel (heading code 7326)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ingots are classified under heading code 7206. These are blocks of metal made by casting the liquid metallic contents of a furnace or crucible into open metallic moulds. Ingots are the raw material for the metal working process.</p><br/><br/><p>Other primary forms are classified under heading code 7206. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>steel in the molten state</li><br/>  <li>blocks and lumps (chiefly obtained from agglomerates or build-ups produced by a direct reduction of iron ore or by electrolytic deposition)</li><br/>  <li>puddled bars and pilings (after rolling, provide a product with a characteristic fibrous structure by virtue of its slag content)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, heading code 7206 excludes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>remelting scrap ingots (heading code 7204)</li><br/>  <li>products obtained by continuous casting (heading code 7207)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Semi-finished products are classified under heading code 7207. These are defined as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>continuously cast products of solid section, whether or not subjected to primary hot rolling</li><br/>  <li>other products of solid section, that have not been further worked other than being subjected to primary hot rolling or roughly shaped by forging, including blanks for angles, shapes or sections</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products may not be in coils.</p><br/><br/><p>Semi-finished products include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>blooms - are larger than billets and are used for re-rolling to bars, rods, angles, shapes and sections or for the manufacture of forgings</li><br/>  <li>billets - are used for re-rolling to bars, rods, angles, shapes and sections or for the manufacture of forgings</li><br/>  <li>rounds - have a circular or polygon cross-section of more than four sides (they are used as intermediate products for the manufacture of seamless-steel tubes and differ from bars and rods in that they are usually supplied in lengths of 1 to 2 metres and their ends are often cut by a blow lamp, whereas bars/rods are normally more accurately cut)</li><br/>  <li>slabs/sheet bars - are rectangular (not square) in section and their widths are greater than their thickness</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>rolled products of solid rectangular (not square) cross section, which do not conform to the definition of semi-finished products, and are in the form of:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>coils of successively superimposed layers</li><br/>      <li>straight lengths that if of a thickness less than 4.75 millimetres are of a width at least 10 times the thickness; or if thickness is 4.75 millimetres or more are of a width which exceeds 150 millimetres and is at least twice the thickness</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/>  <li>those with patterns in relief derived directly from rolling (such as grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and those that have been perforated, corrugated or polished provided they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products other than rectangular or square, of any size are to be classified as products of a width of 600 millimetres or more, provided they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.</p><br/><br/><p>Flat-rolled products classified under heading code 7208 may be subject to surface treatment:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>7208 includes corrugated flat-rolled products</li><br/>  <li>7208 excludes ribbed products with an angular profile (heading code 7216)</li><br/>  <li>7208 excludes flat-rolled products which have been coated, plated or clad with metal, or coated with non-metallic substances (for example paints, enamels or plastics) (heading code 7210)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Hot rolled - this is a method of shaping steel by rolling. The temperature range depends on various factors such as the composition of the steel. For general guidance, the final temperature of the work-piece in hot rolling is about 900°C.</p><br/><br/><p>Cold rolled - this is a process which is carried out on products that have not been heated immediately prior to the cold-rolling operation in which they are reduced to final thickness. The objectives of cold rolling are to improve the surface finish and to obtain smaller and more uniform thickness than is possible in hot rolling. Cold-worked products tend to be very hard and possess great tensile strength.</p><br/><br/><p>Angles and shapes are classified under heading code 7216. These must have the following characteristics:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the sections most commonly falling in this heading are H, I, T, Z, U (including channels) capital omega, obtuse, acute and right L angles</li><br/>  <li>corners can be square or rounded, the limbs equal or unequal and the edges may or may not be bulbed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Alloy steel is defined as steel with additional metals. This is made by smelting mixed ores that may either be added with the steel in the furnace or in the molten bath near the end of the finishing period, in the ladle, or in the moulds.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes, the main ferro-alloys include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ferro-manganese</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silicon</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-manganese</li><br/>  <li>ferro-chromium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-chromium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-nickel</li><br/>  <li>ferro-molybdenum</li><br/>  <li>ferro-tungsten (ferro-wolfram)</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-tungsten</li><br/>  <li>ferro-titanium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-titanium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-vanadium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-niobium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-magnesium</li><br/>  <li>ferro-silico-calcium</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Stainless steel is defined as alloy steel containing, by weight, 1.2% or less of carbon and 10.5% or more of chromium, with or without other elements.</p><br/><br/><p>Cast iron is iron mixed with other metals. The iron must predominate by weight over these additional metals. These additional metals must not be in the quantities stated for the chemical composition of steel - see the page in this guide on iron and steel metal composition.</p><br/><br/><p>Malleable cast iron is cast iron that under pressure or hammering can easily spread and flatten.</p><br/><br/><p>Spheroidal graphite cast iron is not considered as either a non-malleable cast iron (of heading 732510) or a malleable cast iron (heading 732599 first part), but is considered to be ‘a third category’ (within heading 732599 second part).</p><br/><br/><p>Forging is a process where the metal is formed into a shape by heat and pressure.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot-drop forging and drop stamping are methods in the production of metal shapes or sections (usually on a conveyor line) by the hot shaping of cut blanks in dies by means of special tools. These are carried out by pressure or impact, generally in successive phases, following preliminary operations of rolling, hammering, hand forging or bending.</p><br/><br/><p>Wire drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods in irregularly wound coils are drawn through one or more dies at high speed to obtain coiled wire of a smaller diameter.</p><br/><br/><p>Bright drawing is a cold process in which bars or rods, whether or not in irregularly wound coils, are drawn at slow speed through one or more dies to obtain products of smaller or different shaped sections.</p><br/><br/><p>Rolled or obtained by continuous casting is a method of casting molten steel directly into useful or semi-finished shapes.</p><br/><br/><p>Wrought means shaped by hammering or beating.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot extrusion is a process consisting of enclosing a piece of metal heated to forging temperature in a chamber (called a container). High pressure is applied to the metal which is then forced through a die.</p><br/><br/><p>Cold extrusion is a process similar to hot extrusion above except that the metal is at room temperature.</p><br/><br/><p>Dies are metallic or other permanent devices that provide a given shape to a piece of metal. The word in metallurgy covers a range of meanings and includes dies that are used to shape solid metal in presses and those for making die casting from.</p><br/><br/><p>Hot drawing is a process in which metal is heated and passed through a die to produce the finished shape.</p><br/><br/><p>Sintering is where compacted metal powder (obtained by moulding, usually coupled with pressing) is spread out and passed under a burner. The powder ignites. Air is then drawn through the powder causing any sulphur or carbon present to oxidise. This causes a partial fusion of the particles in the powder, leaving them to adhere together in the form of a porous cellular clinker known as a sinter.</p><br/><br/><p>Closed-die forging is where hot metal is shaped within the walls of two dies that come together to enclose the work piece on all sides. The process starts with a rod or bar cut to the length required to fill the die.</p><br/><br/><p>Open-die forging is the process of hammering hot metal between flat or contoured dies. There are three basic types of dies for this process - flat dies, V dies, and swage dies.</p><br/><br/><p>Annealing is the process of heating a metal or alloy to a predetermined temperature (below its melting point) maintaining that temperature for a time, then cooling it slowly. Annealing generally provides softness.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""about-iron-and-steel-treatments"">About iron and steel treatments</h2><br/><br/><p>It’s very useful to understand the different treatments used in the production of iron and steel products, whether they’re surface treatments, subsequent manufacturing or finishing.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""surface-treatments"">Surface treatments</h3><br/><br/><p>Cladding methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>pouring molten cladding metal onto the basic metal, followed by rolling</li><br/>  <li>simple hot rolling of the cladding metal to the basic metal</li><br/>  <li>any other method of deposition of the cladding metal followed by any mechanical or thermal process to ensure welding (for example electro-cladding)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Bear in mind that ferrous products clad with non-ferrous metals remain classified under chapter 72 provided that iron or steel is the predominating metal by weight.</p><br/><br/><p>Plating methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>coating with metal through immersion, hot-dip galvanising, tinning, hot coating with lead and aluminium coating</li><br/>  <li>electroplating, for example with zinc, cadmium, tin, lead, chromium, chromium/chromate, copper, nickel, gold or silver</li><br/>  <li>impregnation or diffusion by heating the product to be coated with the required coating metal in powder form, for example, sherardising (cementation with zinc), calorising (cementation with aluminium) and chromising (with diffusion of chromium)</li><br/>  <li>spraying - atomising the molten coating metal and directing the spray onto the product to be coated</li><br/>  <li>metallisation by evaporating the coating metal in a vacuum</li><br/>  <li>metallisation by bombarding the coating metal with ions in a glow discharge (ion plating)</li><br/>  <li>coating by cathode vaporisation (sputtering)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Coating methods include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>enamelling</li><br/>  <li>varnishing</li><br/>  <li>lacquering</li><br/>  <li>painting</li><br/>  <li>surface printing</li><br/>  <li>coating with ceramics or plastics, including special processes such as glow discharge, electrophoresis, electrostatic projection and immersion in an electrostatic fluidised bath followed by radiation firing</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""subsequent-finishing"">Subsequent finishing</h3><br/><br/><p>Finished products may be subjected to further finishing treatments such as mechanical workings (including turning, milling, grinding, perforation or punching) or surface treatments such as polishing, burnishing, artificial oxidation or chemical surface treatment. As a general rule such processes do not affect the heading under which the goods are classified.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-steel"">Classifying steel</h2><br/><br/><p>There are several thousand steel and alloy-steel grades - all of which have different chemical compositions. In addition, there are all the different possible heat treatments, cold forming conditions, shapes and surface finishes that can make classification of these products difficult.</p><br/><br/><p>However, steels can be classified reasonably easily into a few major groups according to their chemical composition, applications, shapes and surface conditions.</p><br/><br/><p>Chemical composition - steels can be grouped into one of the three classes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>carbon steels</li><br/>  <li>low-alloy steels</li><br/>  <li>high-alloy steels</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>All steels contain a small amount of incidental elements (such as manganese, silicon, aluminium, phosphorus, sulphur and copper) left over from the steel-making process.

They can have a variety of surface conditions and are rolled from slabs.</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>Plates are hot rolled either from slabs or directly from ingots. Plates are usually made in small quantities and to customers’ specifications, with different dimensions and tolerances for flatness, profile, straightness and other properties. The edges can be ordered in either as-rolled condition, or sheared, machined, or gas-cut. Plates are also clad with corrosion-resistant sheets.</li><br/>  <li>Hot-rolled strip is often shipped directly from the mill in large coils. Frequently, the larger coils are slit into narrower coils or edge trimmed or cut to length into sheets at the finishing section of a steel plant. Coils and sheets are shipped either with the hot-rolled surface or with the scale removed and the surface oiled.</li><br/>  <li>Cold-rolled strip is produced from hot-rolled strip. Steel plants provide this product in coils or sheets. Cold-rolled products are available in a great variety of surface conditions, often with a specific roughness, electrolytically cleaned, chemically treated, oiled, or coated with metals such as zinc, tin, chromium, aluminium or with organic substances.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>There are specific dimensions that the goods need to meet if they are classed as flat products.</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Product</th><br/>      <th>Thickness</th><br/>      <th>Width</th><br/>      <th>Length</th><br/>      <th>Weight</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Slabs</td><br/>      <td>50 - 250 millimetres</td><br/>      <td>0.6 - 2.6 metres</td><br/>      <td>12 metres</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Plate</td><br/>      <td>5 - 200 millimetres</td><br/>      <td>1.5 - 3.5 metres</td><br/>      <td>35 metres (max)</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Hot-rolled strip</td><br/>      <td>1.5 - 12 millimetres</td><br/>      <td>0.7 - 2 metres</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>      <td>10 - 35 tons</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Cold-rolled strip</td><br/>      <td>0.1 - 2 millimetres</td><br/>      <td>up to 2 metres</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>Long products are made of either blooms or billets.

They’re sometimes cold drawn or ground to very precise dimensions for use in machine parts. A special group of rounds are the reinforcing bars, which provide tensile strength to concrete sections subjected to a bending load. These normally have hot-rolled protrusions on their surface to improve bonding with the concrete. Some bar mills also produce small channels, angles, tees, zees, and fence-post sections. These products are called merchant bars.</li><br/>  <li>Hot-rolled wire rods: these are shipped in coils. A great portion of these rods are cold-drawn into wire, which is often covered afterward by a metallic coating for corrosion protection.</li><br/>  <li>Structural shapes and rails: common shapes are wide flange I-beams, standard I-beams, channels, angles, tees, zees, H-pilings, and sheet pilings. Rails include railway rails as well as a great number of special rails (for example for cranes and heavy transfer cars or for use in mines and construction).</li><br/>  <li>Tubular steels are broadly grouped into welded and seamless products.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>Once again, there are specific dimensions the goods must meet if they’re to be classified as long products.</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Product</th><br/>      <th>Diameter</th><br/>      <th>Wall thickness</th><br/>      <th>Weight</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Rounds (Bar)</td><br/>      <td>Up to 250 millimetres</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>      <td>-</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Reinforcing bars</td><br/>      <td>10 -

These can be agglomerated, used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as deoxidants, desulphurising agents or other similar usage. They’re generally not malleable and must contain by weight at least 4% of the element iron and one or more of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>manganese</li><br/>  <li>phosphorus</li><br/>  <li>silicon</li><br/>  <li>chromium</li><br/>  <li>carbon</li><br/>  <li>copper</li><br/>  <li>nickel</li><br/>  <li>aluminium</li><br/>  <li>boron</li><br/>  <li>cobalt</li><br/>  <li>molybdenum</li><br/>  <li>lead</li><br/>  <li>niobium</li><br/>  <li>titanium</li><br/>  <li>tungsten (wolfram)</li><br/>  <li>vanadium</li><br/>  <li>zirconium</li><br/>  <li>other elements</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>It’s also important to note that a ferro-alloy can only be considered as a binary and classified under a specific relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the elements listed above exceeds the minimum percentage listed. Otherwise it must be classified as a ternary or quaternary alloy as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, for a ferro-alloy to be correctly classified as ferro-silico-manganese, it must have more than 30% manganese and more than 8% silicon. If it has 7% silicon it is viewed as a binary ferro-alloy and must be classified as ferro-manganese in this example.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

Since then millions of gift-aiders and thousands of charities have benefitted. Last year alone Gift Aid was worth nearly £1.2 billion to UK charity sector. In total over £13 billion of Gift Aid relief has been paid to charities since 1990.</p><br/><br/><p>Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Damian Hinds said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>I’m delighted that we have now seen a quarter of a century of Gift Aid. In that time the scheme has helped people across the UK see their gift go that bit further.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">We will continue to improve the scheme whilst encouraging more charities and people to make the most of it to maximise the Gift Aid claimed on eligible donations.</p><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The government is continuing to work on refining the Gift Aid scheme to make it simpler for charities to claim on eligible donations. In 2013, government introduced an online system for charities to submit Gift Aid applications online, reducing the time taken to process Gift Aid payments to charities from around 15 working days to less than five days.</p><br/><br/><p>The government has also worked with the sector to develop a new, simpler, <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/467898/Charity_GAD_Single_Donation.pdf"">Gift Aid form</a> which will be introduced in April 2016, to make it easier for eligible donors to sign up to Gift Aid their donations.</p><br/><br/><p>Support for the sector extends beyond Gift Aid. For example, from April 2016 the government will increase the limit on the amount of money a charity can claim through the Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme each year, from £5,000 to £8,000. This means charities can receive a ‘top up’ on small donations like the money you give to a collection tin.</p><br/><br/><p>So how can you sign up for Gift Aid?</p><br/><br/><p>As an individual – you must have paid enough tax to cover the Gift Aid claimed on your donation. You can then complete a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-gift-aid-declaration-form-for-a-single-donation"">Gift Aid declaration form</a> alongside your donation.</p><br/><br/><p>As a charity - you need to register for charitable status with HMRC. <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/claim-gift-aid"">GOV.UK</a> demonstrates the process.</p><br/></div></p>",

True tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco) are classified in chapter 24 of the UK Trade Tariff (Tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes). Tobacco related products, for example, tobacco oil, smoking replacement treatments may be classified elsewhere in the tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>You can get tobacco supplied in a variety of different ways:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>in a raw, unprocessed or unmanufactured state</li><br/>  <li>as manufactured cigars, cigarettes or cigarillos</li><br/>  <li>as prepared loose smoking tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as prepared chewing tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as snuff</li><br/>  <li>as prepared to be heated</li><br/>  <li>as homogenised or reconstituted tobacco</li><br/>  <li>as an extract or essence</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There are a range of manufactured tobacco and smoking substitutes. Some of these are classified as tobacco even though they do not contain any tobacco. This guide will explain where you should classify each of the products.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""raw-and-unprocessed-tobacco"">Raw and unprocessed tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>You can classify all forms of unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco refuse under heading 2401 - unmanufactured tobacco, tobacco refuse.</p><br/><br/><p>The term ‘unmanufactured tobacco’ includes many forms. It could be tobacco supplied as whole plants or leaves in the natural state, or as cured or fermented leaves.</p><br/><br/><p>It also includes tobacco which has been:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>stemmed or stripped</li><br/>  <li>trimmed or untrimmed</li><br/>  <li>broken or cut, including pieces cut to shape</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Tobacco leaves which have been blended, stemmed or stripped and ‘cased’ (‘sauced’ or ‘liquored’) with a liquid of appropriate composition to prevent, mould, drying and to preserve the flavour, are also covered in this heading. It does not include tobacco which is ready for smoking.</p><br/><br/><p>Unprocessed tobacco that is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>already prepared for retail distribution</li><br/>  <li>split from a bulk consignment into smaller quantities</li><br/>  <li>going to be processed into smokeable state at home (for example in a domestic blender or shredder)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This is considered smokeable without further industrial processing.</p><br/><br/><p>If the product meets this specification you can classify it to commodity code 2403191000 (tobacco, other manufactured, smoking tobacco, other, in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 500 grams).</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco refuse includes all waste resulting from:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the manipulation of tobacco leaves</li><br/>  <li>the manufacture of tobacco products</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This includes, for example, stalks, stems, midribs, trimmings, dust.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""cigars-cheroots-cigarillos-and-cigarettes-of-tobacco-or-of-tobacco-substitutes"">Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes</h2><br/><br/><p>Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes that are made of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tobacco</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of tobacco</li><br/>  <li>tobacco substitutes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These are classifiable under heading 2402 regardless of the proportions of tobacco present in the mixture.  For example, ‘cigarettes’ made from specially processed leaves of a variety of lettuce and contain neither tobacco nor nicotine would also classifiable under this heading.</p><br/><br/><p>Loose tobacco including pipe tobacco and tobacco for hand rolling cigarettes are classifiable under heading 2403. <a href=""#loose-hand-rolling-and-pipe-tobacco"">Find out about hand-rolling and pipe tobacco</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading does not cover medicinal cigarettes. Cigarettes containing certain types of products formulated to discourage the habit of smoking but which do not have medicinal properties remain classified in this heading.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""loose-hand-rolling-and-pipe-tobacco"">Loose hand-rolling and pipe tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>Smoking tobacco includes loose hand-rolling and pipe tobacco - whether or not it contains tobacco substitutes in any proportion - for use with a hookah or water pipe, all of these are classifiable under 2403 10. It also includes products which do not contain any tobacco at all.</p><br/><br/><p>Smoking tobacco is tobacco which has been cut or otherwise split, twisted or pressed into blocks which can be smoked without further industrial processing.</p><br/><br/><p>A hookah or water pipe uses a small charcoal tablet to gently heat a special, flavour-infused tobacco blend. The tobacco never burns, but is filtered as it’s drawn through water in the glass base before it’s inhaled through the hoses.</p><br/><br/><p>Depending on locality, hookahs are known by other names:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>shisha or sheesha</li><br/>  <li>hubble bubble</li><br/>  <li>nargeela - also known as nargile, narghile, nargileh or narguile</li><br/>  <li>argeela - also as arghileh or arguile</li><br/>  <li>boury</li><br/>  <li>gouza</li><br/>  <li>okka</li><br/>  <li>kalyan</li><br/>  <li>gewat suckre</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This style of pipe can be used for smoking many substances, including herbal fruits and tobacco. An example is shisha tobacco, which can also be known as tabac, tombak, tumbak, gouza, guza, moassel or sheesha. Shisha is a mixture of tobacco, molasses or sugar that is flavoured with fruit, glycerol, aromatic oils and extracts for example Meassel or Massel. The name is also used for products not containing molasses or sugar, for example Tumbak or Ajmani.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain tobacco are covered by subheading 240311. Tobacco-free products for water pipes, for example, Jurak - are classified under subheading 240399.</p><br/><br/><p>Cartridges and refills intended to be used in water pipe (Hookah) as a fog fluid containing aromatic flavourings are classified under subheading 38249992 if in liquid and 38249993 if other.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""homogenised-or-reconstituted-tobacco-and-tobacco-extracts-and-essences"">‘Homogenised’ or ‘reconstituted’ tobacco and tobacco extracts and essences</h2><br/><br/><p>‘Homogenised’ or ‘reconstituted’ tobacco includes products made of reformed tobacco made from tobacco leaves, tobacco refuse or dust. It’s sometimes supplied on a backing, for example, a sheet of cellulose from tobacco stems, and is generally put up in the form of rectangular sheets, also known as blunts, or strip. It can either be used as a wrapper in sheet form or shredded or chopped as a filler. All homogenised and reconstituted tobacco products are classified under 2403 91 00.</p><br/><br/><p>Manufactured tobacco substitutes include smoking mixtures which do not contain any tobacco. These may have a basis of herbs or another plants.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco extracts and essences are liquids which are extracted from moist tobacco leaves by either pressure, or prepared by boiling waste tobacco in water. They’re used for the manufacture of insecticides or parasiticides.</p><br/><br/><p>Manufactured tobacco substitutes and tobacco extracts and essences are classified under 2403 99 90.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco seed oil is not classified as a tobacco product and should be classified under heading 1515 - other fixed vegetable fats and oils.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""chewing-tobacco"">Chewing tobacco</h2><br/><br/><p>Chewing tobacco is usually a highly fermented and liquored form of tobacco which is designed to be chewed, not smoked. It’s supplied in long strands of whole or very coarsely shredded leaves, or in the form of rolls, sticks, strips, cubes and blocks. It’s consumed by placing a part of the tobacco between the cheek and gum or the teeth and is then chewed. It’s classified under heading code 2403 99 10.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as western styles of chewing tobacco, there are many ethnic varieties of chewing tobacco but all styles are classifiable to 2403 99 10.</p><br/><br/><p>Paan masala is a filling often used in a type of Indian snack called Paan. This is where a betal leaf is used as a wrapping and the whole product is chewed as a palate cleanser and breath freshener. It is usually taken after meals and during leisure hours.</p><br/><br/><p>The ingredients of Paan Masalas vary with some containing tobacco whilst others are tobacco free. Classification of the products depends on what the product is made of and the intention of the product. For example a betel leaf filled with a mixture of coarsely ground or chopped betel nuts and other spices (paan supari) would be classifiable under heading 2008 as a preparation of nuts. If the paan contains tobacco (tambaku paan) in any proportion it should be classified under heading 2403.</p><br/><br/><p>Gutka is a preparation of crushed betel nuts, (supari) tobacco, catechu, lime, elachi (cardamoms), perfumed and permitted spices and flavours, and is consumed like chewing tobacco. This should be classified in the same way as paan under heading 2403.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""snuff"">Snuff</h2><br/><br/><p>Snuff, and tobacco which is compressed or liquored for the purpose of making snuff, is classified under heading 2403 99 10. Snuff is tobacco in powder or grain form which has been treated so that it can be taken as snuff and not smoked. There are 2 types of snuff, nasal snuff and oral snuff, also known as snus.</p><br/><br/><p>Nasal snuff is a dry to semi moist finely ground tobacco product which is mainly used in the nasal cavity. Nasal snuff exists in different flavour varieties.</p><br/><br/><p>Snus is a moist to semi moist, ground, oral tobacco product, which is used between the gum and the upper lip in the oral cavity. Snus exists in 2 packaging formats, loose and portion packed. Both forms exist in different flavour varieties. Unlike chewing tobacco oral snuff sachets are placed in the mouth between the gum and the lip, the user then sucks on the product and the nicotine soaks through the thin layer of skin into the bloodstream.</p><br/><br/><p>Note that Pakistani Neswar is also classified as snuff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""tobacco-for-heating-products"">Tobacco for heating products</h2><br/><br/><p>Tobacco for heating is a recent innovation in the tobacco market. It is used in devices that operate in a variety of ways, but they all contain processed tobacco that is heated, not burned as it is in conventional tobacco products, to produce or flavour vapour. In such devices, the tobacco is delivered in a manner which means it cannot be smoked. They are distinct from e-cigarettes, which do not contain tobacco.</p><br/><br/><p>Tobacco for heating is processed tobacco which has been treated and is delivered so that it cannot be smoked. In general a small amount is contained in a capsule which is inserted into a hand-held device. The device heats the tobacco to release flavours and nicotine but without combustion of the tobacco.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""nicotine-replacements-and-addiction-relief"">Nicotine replacements and addiction relief</h2><br/><br/><p>There are a number of different relief products and alternatives to cigarettes on the market including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>patches</li><br/>  <li>chewing gum</li><br/>  <li>electronic cigarettes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There’s no one classification for all these items but they’re instead classified based on their own characteristics.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine replacement (preparation, tablets, chewing gum) is classified under commodity code 2106 90 92 60 as a miscellaneous edible preparation. This is in line with EU Regulation 3565/88.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine based hand gel, is a gel rubbed into the hands so the nicotine is absorbed through the skin to weaken the craving for a cigarette. This is marketed as an alternative to cigarettes for situations in which one cannot smoke. The gels are classified as tobacco products under 38249993.</p><br/><br/><p>Nicotine patches (transdermal systems) intended to help smokers to stop smoking are classified to heading 38249958.</p><br/><br/><p>Electronic cigarette and nicotine inhalers, also known as an inhalator. If you have imported an electronic cigarette with a packet of cartridges, the whole set is to be classified together to commodity code 8543 70 90 99 as an electrical product not elsewhere specified. In line with EC Regulation 1143/2008.</p><br/><br/><p>A nicotine cartridge and refills containing a preparation of nicotine intended to assist smokers to stop smoking is classified to heading 38249956 and 38249957 if other.</p><br/><br/><p>Inhalators are classified according to the cartridges they’re supplied with and these are classified in the same way as cartridges for the electronic cigarette.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""excise-duty-on-tobacco-products"">Excise Duty on tobacco products</h2><br/><br/><p>Excise Duty is the most significant charge levied on the import of tobacco products. The determination and application of Excise Duty is not dependent upon classification but instead upon the Tobacco Products (Descriptions of Products) Order 2003. This means that the classification of these products in no way determines whether excise is due or the excise rate which will apply.</p><br/><br/><p>Find out more about any duty due in <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/tobacco-products-duty"">relation to your products</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>Read more about <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-476-tobacco-products-duty"">Excise Notice 476: Tobacco Products Duty</a></p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p>You can get further help by contacting the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries"">Imports and exports: general enquiries helpline</a>.</p><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

For example, the UK is home to many of the world’s leading VFX companies including those behind award-winning films such as Gravity.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as its creative and technology companies, the film industry relies upon a variety of sectors from catering to security, who have also felt the positive effects of the tax relief. BFI figures show that film production supports around 40,000 full-time jobs in the UK, which is a 22% increase from 2009.</p><br/><br/><p>Introduced in 2007, the film tax relief was extended to 25% for films of all budget levels on 1 April 2015 to support UK film making. The relief is available to films which qualify as British productions through a cultural test or via an official UK co-production treaty.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""key-facts-and-further-information"">Key facts and further information</h2><br/><br/><p>Based on UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief, there was an increase of 25% in industry investment into our creative economy in comparison to 2014. UK expenditure from films which qualified for tax relief (final or interim certification for film tax relief) went from £1.297 billion in 2012 to 2013 to £1.627 billion in 2014 to 2015.</p><br/><br/><p>Inward investment has allowed greater collaboration between US production companies and UK films.

For household and general lighting equipment, check heading code 9405 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff), where you can classify a piece of equipment according to its type, its intended use and the type of material from which it’s predominantly manufactured.</p><br/><br/><p>For lamps and lighting equipment designed for use in motor vehicles or self-powered portable lights, check heading codes 8512 and 8513 respectively.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying replacement bulbs, lamps and parts there are a number of very specific headings to consider. However, the vast majority of replacement bulbs and lamps are classified under heading code 8539, so provided you know which type of bulb or lamp you’re importing, you should be able to find the correct code.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide will help you to classify electric lamps correctly. In general terms, electric lamps are not complex to classify, provided you have an understanding of the type of lamp and its intended use.</p><br/><br/><p>You’ll have to check different parts of the Tariff to find the correct classification as lamps for specific purposes are classified in the chapter of the Tariff most appropriate to their use. For example, toy lamps are classified in chapter 95 (toys), while battery-powered torches are classified in chapter 85 (machinery and mechanical appliances).</p><br/><br/><p>The more detailed information you have about the type of lamp or bulb, the easier it will be to classify it correctly. You need to know the type of lamp (such as halogen, tungsten, fluorescent) and the voltage.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""quick-reference-table-for-heading-codes"">Quick reference table for heading codes</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric ceiling or wall-lighting fittings, chandeliers, excluding those of a kind used for lighting public open spaces or thoroughfares</td><br/>      <td>9405 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric table, desk, bedside or floor-standing lamps</td><br/>      <td>9405 20</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Lighting sets of a kind used for Christmas trees</td><br/>      <td>9405 30</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Searchlights and spotlights</td><br/>      <td>9405 40 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Toy lamps or lighting figures</td><br/>      <td>9503</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Lighting or visual-signalling equipment used on bicycles</td><br/>      <td>8512 10 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Other lighting or visual signalling equipment</td><br/>      <td>8512 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Portable electric lamps designed to function by their own source of energy, for example, battery power torch</td><br/>      <td>8513 10 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Electric filament or discharge lamps, including sealed beam lamp units and ultra-violet or infra-red lamps, arc lamps; light-emitting diode (LED) lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Seal beam lamp units</td><br/>      <td>8539 10 00 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Seal beam lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 29 30 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Halogen lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 30 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Xenon lamps for motor vehicles</td><br/>      <td>8539 39 80 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Mains voltage halogen bulbs greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 92 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Low voltage halogen bulbs less than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 21 98 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Standard tungsten lamps greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 22 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tungsten reflector lamps greater than 100 volts</td><br/>      <td>8539 22 10 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Fluorescent tube - double ended cap type</td><br/>      <td>8539 3110 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Energy-saving lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 31 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Mercury vapour lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Sodium vapour lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 20 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Metal halide lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 32 90 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Neon lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 39 80 90</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Ultra-violet lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 49 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Infra-red lamps</td><br/>      <td>8539 49 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps and bulbs</td><br/>      <td>8539 50 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LED strip comprising of Light Emitting Diodes, transistors, resistors and protection diodes, (EC Reg 708/2013)</td><br/>      <td>940540</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Photographic flashes</td><br/>      <td>9006 61 00 00</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>You will find lamps classified in the Tariff according to their predominant use.

This guide covers classifying plastics according to their polymer type and some specific plastic goods only covered in chapter 39, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>polyethylene</li><br/>  <li>polyurethane</li><br/>  <li>polystyrene</li><br/>  <li>plastic tubes and pipes</li><br/>  <li>plastic floor coverings</li><br/>  <li>plastic bathroom furnishings</li><br/>  <li>plastic packaging materials</li><br/>  <li>plastic tableware and kitchenware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This guide provides an outline of the basic chemistry related to polymers, a simple summary of manufacturing processes and practical tips on classifying specific finished or processed goods.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""quick-reference-table-of-heading-codes"">Quick reference table of heading codes</h2><br/><br/><p>There are 2 broad categories for plastics and plastic articles covered in chapter 39:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>polymers in primary form - these include liquids, pastes, blocks of irregular shapes, lumps, powders, granules and flakes, polymers in primary form are classified within headings 3901 to 3914</li><br/>  <li>specific types of goods made from polymers (known as plastics)  fall within chapter 39, plastic articles are classified within headings 3915 to 3926</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Examples of some of the headings of chapter 39 are shown below:</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polymers of ethylene in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3901</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polymers of propylene in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3902</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polymers of styrene in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3903</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polymers of vinyl chloride or other halogenated olefins in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3904</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polymers of vinyl acetate or of other vinyl esters and other vinyl polymers in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3905</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Acrylic polymers in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3906</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polyacetals, other polyethers and epoxide resins, polycarbonates, alkyd resins, polyallyl esters and other polyesters in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3907</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Polyamides in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3908</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Amino-resins, phenolic resins and polyurethanes in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3909</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Silicones in primary forms</td><br/>      <td>3910</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Waste, parings and scrap of plastics</td><br/>      <td>3915</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tubes, pipes and hoses and fittings such as joints, elbows or flanges of plastic</td><br/>      <td>3917</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Floor coverings of plastics in rolls or tiles, wall or ceiling coverings of plastics</td><br/>      <td>3918</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Self-adhesive plates, sheets, film, foil, tape, strip and other flat shapes, of plastics, whether or not in rolls</td><br/>      <td>3919</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Baths, shower-baths, sinks, washbasins, bidets, lavatory pans, Seats and covers, flushing cisterns and similar sanitary ware, of plastics</td><br/>      <td>3922</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Articles for the conveyance or packing of goods, of plastics; stoppers, lids, caps and other closures, of plastics</td><br/>      <td>3923</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tableware, kitchenware, other household articles and hygienic or toilet articles, of plastics</td><br/>      <td>3924</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>For processed and finished items, it’s useful to know the composition details of the polymer and the manufacturing process. Remember that if the defining characteristic of the good is its manufacture from plastic, such as a plastic bottle or a plastic hose, it will be classified in chapter 39 of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-polymers-in-primary-forms"">Classifying polymers in primary forms</h2><br/><br/><p>If you’re importing polymers in primary forms, it’s essential to know the chemical composition and what the predominant monomer is within the polymer.</p><br/><br/><p>The definition of ‘primary forms’ is:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>liquids and pastes, including dispersions (ie emulsions and suspensions) and solutions</li><br/>  <li>blocks or irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Polymers are large molecules made from monomers, and their constituent parts are called monomeric units. A monomer is a molecule or compound, usually containing carbon, which is capable of conversion to polymers, synthetic resins or elastomers by combination with itself or other similar molecules or compounds.</p><br/><br/><p>There are many different polymers that exhibit different characteristics and properties and are used for different purposes. For example, polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>) is commonly used in the building industry for use in double glazing frames. Polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate (<abbr title=""Polypropylene and polyethethylene terephthalate"">PET</abbr>) are commonly used in the manufacture of bottles.</p><br/><br/><p>To correctly classify your polymers in primary forms, you need to identify the predominant monomer:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>polymers of ethylene (heading 3901)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of propylene (heading 3902)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of styrene (heading 3903)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of vinyl chloride or other halogenated olefins (heading 3904)</li><br/>  <li>polymers of vinyl acetate or of other vinyl esters and other vinyl polymers (heading 3905)</li><br/>  <li>acrylic polymers (heading 3906)</li><br/>  <li>polyacetals, other polyethers and epoxide resins, polycarbonates, alkyd resins, polyallyl esters and other polyesters (heading 3907)</li><br/>  <li>polyamides (heading 3908)</li><br/>  <li>amino-resins, phenolic resins and polyurethanes (heading 3909)</li><br/>  <li>silicones (heading 3910)</li><br/>  <li>petroleum resins, coumarone-indene resins, polyterpenes, polysulphides, polysulphones (heading 3911)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Copolymers are produced by the simultaneous polymerisation of 2 or more dissimilar monomers. They contain more than one type or repeat of monomeric unit. For example, the copolymer ethylene-vinyl acetate  is created by polymerising ethylene and vinyl acetate.</p><br/><br/><p>In Tariff classification, the term ‘copolymer’ covers all polymers in which no single monomer contributes 95% or more by weight to the total polymer content.</p><br/><br/><p>However, they are produced, copolymers - including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers - are classified under the heading code covering the predominant comonomer. If no comonomer predominates, you should classify the goods in the heading code which is last in numerical order that is relevant to each of the comonomers.</p><br/><br/><p>Chemically modified polymers, where only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are classified under the heading code for the unmodified polymer.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-processed-or-finished-products"">Classifying processed or finished products</h2><br/><br/><p>When classifying processed or finished plastic products, it’s helpful to know as much about them as possible, including the:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>function or role of the goods</li><br/>  <li>polymer that they are made from</li><br/>  <li>method of manufacture</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The function or role of the goods is essential to classifying them correctly. The composition and method of manufacture may also be required to classify the goods correctly, although this is not always the case. However, it’s a very good idea to have all this information to hand as it will speed the classification process for you.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""manufacturing-techniques"">Manufacturing techniques</h3><br/><br/><p>Polymers in primary forms are processed using 3 different processes to create finished products:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>injection moulding is used to form plastics into hollow shapes - for example, bottles and containers, toys or petrol tanks</li><br/>  <li>compression moulding is used to form specific shapes using a mould - for example, knobs and handles for saucepans, irons or cookers or electrical fittings such as plugs, sockets and lamp fittings</li><br/>  <li>extrusion creates shapes by forcing material through a metal forming die - for example, film, sheet, rods, profile shapes, tubes or pipes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""classifying-specific-types-of-finished-or-processed-goods"">Classifying specific types of finished or processed goods</h3><br/><br/><p>If waste, parings and scrap (heading code 3915) have been transformed into a primary form, they should be classified as such, using the appropriate heading code between 3901 and 3914.</p><br/><br/><p>When classifying tubes, pipes and hoses (heading code 3917), you should bear in mind that the definition covers all hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished, that are of a kind generally used for moving gases or liquids, such as ribbed garden hoses, perforated tubes or lay-flat tubing. However, if the goods have an internal cross-section that is not round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a  regular polygon, they’re not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.</p><br/><br/><p>To classify wall or ceiling coverings made of plastic (heading code 3918), they must be in rolls, of a width not less than 45 centimetres, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated. This is to differentiate them from some wallpapers.</p><br/><br/><p>There are very specific products covered under builders’ ware of plastic (heading code 3925).</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres</li><br/>  <li>structural elements used in floors, walls or partitions, and ceilings or roofs</li><br/>  <li>gutters and gutter fittings</li><br/>  <li>doors, windows and their frames, and thresholds for doors</li><br/>  <li>balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers</li><br/>  <li>shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof</li><br/>  <li>large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example in shops, workshops and warehouses</li><br/>  <li>ornamental architectural features, for example flutings, cupolas and dovecotes</li><br/>  <li>fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings - for example knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>In some cases, textiles may be added to plastic products to provide reinforcement. If the plastic is cellular and has been covered on one face only with the textile fabric, you should classify it under the appropriate heading code in chapter 39. If the plastic is covered on both faces, the goods should be classified as a textile, using the appropriate heading code in chapter 59.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""common-abbreviations-for-plastics-and-polymers"">Common abbreviations for plastics and polymers</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Abbreviation</th><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>ABS</td><br/>      <td>Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>BDS</td><br/>      <td>Butadiene-styrene block copolymer</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CA</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose acetate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CB</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose butyrate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>CE</td><br/>      <td>Cellulose/cellophane</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>EVA</td><br/>      <td>Ethylene-vinyl acetate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>GPPS</td><br/>      <td>General-purpose polystyrene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>GRP</td><br/>      <td>Glass-reinforced plastic</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>HDPE</td><br/>      <td>High-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>HIPS</td><br/>      <td>High-impact polystyrene (toughened polystyrene)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LDPE</td><br/>      <td>Low-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>LLDPE</td><br/>      <td>Linear Low-density polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>MF</td><br/>      <td>Melamine formaldehyde</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>OPP</td><br/>      <td>Orientated polypropylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA</td><br/>      <td>Polyamide (nylon)</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 4 6</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 4 6</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 6 10</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 6 10</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 11</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 11</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PA 12</td><br/>      <td>Nylon 12</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PBT</td><br/>      <td>Polybutylene terephthalate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PC</td><br/>      <td>Polycarbonate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>PE</td><br/>      <td>Polyethylene</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td><abbr title=""Polypropylene and polyethethylene terephthalate"">PET</abbr></td><br/>      <td>Polyethylene terephthalate</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-39"">What’s not covered in chapter 39</h2><br/><br/><p>Goods are only classified under their constituent materials when they are not specifically referred to elsewhere in the Tariff. There is a multitude of goods made from plastics that are specifically covered elsewhere in the Tariff, for example:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>textiles and textile articles are covered in Section XI - for example knitted or woven polyester or nylon articles</li><br/>  <li>footwear, headgear, umbrellas, walking sticks, whips or riding crops are covered in Section XII</li><br/>  <li>imitation jewellery</li><br/>  <li>machines and mechanical or electrical appliances, parts of aircraft or vehicles are covered in Section XVII</li><br/>  <li>optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments, clocks and watches, musical instruments and accessories are covered in Section XVIII</li><br/>  <li>furniture, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs or prefabricated buildings are covered in chapter 94</li><br/>  <li>toys, games and sports requisites are covered in chapter 95</li><br/>  <li>brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette holders, pens or propelling pencils are covered in chapter 96</li><br/>  <li>plastics that have been printed with motifs, text or pictures that define the goods (apart from floor, wall or ceiling coverings) are covered in chapter 49</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""finished-and-processed-products"">Finished and processed products</h3><br/><p>It’s useful to consider if the fact it is made from a plastic is its defining characteristic when you classify a product made from plastics.</p><br/><br/><p>As a general rule of thumb, if the defining characteristic is that a product is made of plastic, you will find it in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, a plastic bottle or floorcovering is classified under this chapter. However, spectacle frames which happen to be made of plastic are classified elsewhere, as the fact they are spectacle frames is the defining factor, not their construction from plastic.</p><br/><br/><p>Statuettes and other ornamental articles for the home and garden consisting of rock powder (for example calcium carbonate), plastic, and sometimes a small amount of other additives are classified within chapter 39 when the plastic gives the articles their essential character. The rock powder in this case acts as the filler material with the plastic supplying the defining characteristic for the product.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""general-interpretive-rules"">General Interpretive Rules</h3><br/><br/><p>In common with many commodities, the General Interpretive Rules apply to plastics.</p><br/><br/><p>Where goods are presented as sets that comprise 2 or more separate articles that may fall under different classification codes, they should be classified under the code that represents the primary function of the set. To qualify as a set, the items must be presented together and be clearly complementary.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

Civil aircraft or parts for use in civil aircraft (where designated) are subject to end use control. The description ‘civil aircraft’ is defined as aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the EU member states which carry a military or non-civil registration. For all relevant nomenclature descriptions ‘civil aircraft’ is to be taken to include civil ground flying trainers.</p><br/><br/><p>The subheading 8802 11 00 covers multi-rotor helicopters (so-called ‘drones’ of an unladen weight not exceeding 2,000 kilograms) of different sizes which can operate autonomously (to a pre-programmed destination) or are remotely piloted by the user.</p><br/><br/><p>If they have the character of toys or recreational models, they are classified under heading 9503. See the Explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature to that heading.</p><br/><br/><p>Drones integrated with a camera must be considered under heading 852580.</p><br/><br/><p>This guide will help you classify aircraft parts and accessories using the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-are-considered-to-be-parts-of-aircraft-in-heading-8803"">What are considered to be ‘parts of aircraft’ in heading 8803</h2><br/><br/><p>Heading 8803 of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom covers parts of the goods falling in heading 8801 or 8802, provided that those parts fulfil both of the following conditions:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>they must be identifiable as being suitable for use solely or principally with the goods of headings 8801 (balloons and dirigibles, gliders and hang gliders and other non-powered aircraft), or 8802 (other aircraft (helicopters aeroplanes), spacecraft (including satellites) and suborbital and spacecraft launch vehicles</li><br/>  <li>they must not be excluded by the provisions of the notes to section XVII of the Tariff</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""items-excluded-by-the-provisions-of-the-notes-to-section-xvii"">Items excluded by the provisions of the notes to section XVII</h3><br/><br/><p>The expressions ‘parts’ and ‘parts and accessories’ don ot apply to the following articles, whether they are identifiable as for the goods of this section:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>joints, washers and the like of any material (classified according to their constituent material or in heading 8484) or other articles of vulcanised rubber other than hard rubber (heading 4016)</li><br/>  <li>parts of general use, as defined in note 2 to section XV, of base metal (section XV), or similar goods of plastics (chapter 39)</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 82 (tools)</li><br/>  <li>articles of heading 8306</li><br/>  <li>machines or apparatus of headings 8401 to 8479, or parts of that, articles of heading 8481 or 8482 or, provided they constitute integral parts of engines or motors, articles of heading 8483</li><br/>  <li>electrical machinery or equipment (chapter 85)</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 90</li><br/>  <li>articles of chapter 91</li><br/>  <li>arms (chapter 93)</li><br/>  <li>lamps or lighting fittings of heading 9405</li><br/>  <li>brushes of a kind used as parts of vehicles (heading 9603)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>References in chapters 86 to 88 to ‘parts and accessories’ do not apply to parts and accessories which are not suitable for use solely or mainly with the articles of those chapters. A part or accessory which answers to a description in 2 or more of the headings of those chapters is classified under that heading which corresponds to the main use of that part or accessory.</p><br/><br/><p>There are other exclusions not mentioned in the above notes, where there are specific raised headings for the items, for example:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>700721 80 10 - laminated safety glass - windshields, not framed, for use in civil aircraft</li><br/>  <li>940110 00 - seats of a kind used for aircraft</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Where items are mentioned under their own raised heading, they are to be classified to their respective raised heading and not as parts under 8803.</p><br/><br/><p>The section and chapter notes should be used at all times when classifying any product. It should never be assumed that because ‘parts’ are intended for aircraft they will be classified under heading 8803. </p><br/><br/><p>Heading 8803 covers parts of the goods covered in heading 8801 or 8802 and includes:</p><br/><br/><p>Parts of balloons and dirigibles such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>nacelles</li><br/>  <li>envelopes and parts of that (strips or panels)</li><br/>  <li>carrier hoops</li><br/>  <li>ballonets</li><br/>  <li>rigid frames and sections of that</li><br/>  <li>stabilisers and rudders</li><br/>  <li>propellers for dirigibles</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Parts of aircraft including gliders and kites, such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>fuselages and hulls, fuselage or hull sections, also their internal or external parts (for example, radomes, tail cones, fairings, panels, partitions, luggage compartments, floors, instrument panels, frames, doors, escape chutes, windows, port-holes) - the windows and portholes mentioned here are of laminated glass and framed - if unframed they are classified in 7007</li><br/>  <li>wings and their components (spars, ribs, cross-members)</li><br/>  <li>control surfaces, whether or not movable (for example, ailerons, slats, spoilers, flaps, elevators, rudders, stabilisers, servo-tabs)</li><br/>  <li>nacelles, cowlings, engine pods and pylons</li><br/>  <li>undercarriages (including brakes and brake assemblies) and their retracting equipment, wheels (with or without tyres), landing skis</li><br/>  <li>seaplane floats</li><br/>  <li>propellers (airscrews), rotors for helicopters and gyroplanes, blades for propellers and rotors, pitch control mechanisms for propellers and rotors</li><br/>  <li>control levers (control columns, rudder-bars and various other operational levers)</li><br/>  <li>fuel tanks, including auxiliary fuel tanks</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""goods-often-misclassified-as-parts"">Goods often misclassified as parts</h2><br/><br/><p>Please note any products listed below that are covered by heading 9930, will be classified in this heading.</p><br/><br/><p>Rubber hoses are classified in chapter 40 whether they have fittings, for example, hoses with fittings for aircraft are classified in heading 4009.</p><br/><br/><p>Gaskets and seals are usually cut to specific shapes. If made of vulcanised rubber, they are classified in heading 4016, specifically in subheading 401693.</p><br/><br/><p>Items of hard rubber are classified in heading 4017. Gaskets and similar joints of metal sheeting, combined with other materials, are covered by heading 8484, specifically in subheading 848410. If made of a single layer of one metal, the goods will be classified as an article of that specific metal.</p><br/><br/><p>Electrical insulating materials such as heat shrink polyolefin tube with no electrical connections would be classified according to its material, rather than its use. Polyolefin is a plastic material and would be classified in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><p>Paints, adhesives, fillers and mastics are all classified to their respective headings.</p><br/><br/><p>Automatic data processing (<abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr>) machines are classified under heading 8471, see note 5(A) to chapter 84, and in particular note 5(A) (2). This heading is intended primarily to cover laptop and desktop PCs, which allow the user full interactivity for example, by word processing and spreadsheet applications.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr> machines that can only operate on fixed programmes, which cannot be modified by the user, (even if they can choose between several fixed programmes), are classified within their own specific raised headings, and not as a part of an <abbr title=""Automatic Data Processing"">ADP</abbr> machine, see note 5(E) to chapter 84, ‘Machines incorporating or working in conjunction with an automatic data-processing machine and performing a specific function other than data processing are to be classified in the heading appropriate to their respective functions or, failing that, in residual headings.’ For example, navigational equipment is classified in heading 9014.</p><br/><br/><p>Radios for radio broadcasting reception only - heading 8527. For reception and transmission - heading 8517. Parts of radios will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 85 (see note 2 to section XVI). </p><br/><br/><p>Radio navigation equipment including GPS systems (Global Positioning Satellite) - heading 8526. Parts of radio navigation equipment will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 85 (see note 2 to section XVI).</p><br/><br/><p>Other navigational instruments and appliances including Sonar - heading 9014. Parts and accessories of other navigational instruments and appliances will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 90 (see note 2 to chapter 90).</p><br/><br/><p>Weapons computers - chapter 93. Any computer that’s integral to, or specially designed for a particular weapon, would be classified in the appropriate parts heading. The complete weapon including the weapons computers would be classified in the appropriate heading within chapter 93. (Please note it is unlikely for weapons system computer to be classfied to 8471, being as these computers have a function other than data processing).</p><br/><br/><p>Measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines, including test sets will be classified within chapter 90.</p><br/><br/><p>Test benches generally consist of a frame with a measuring or calibrating instrument. They are used to test engines, motors, electrical generators, pumps, speed indicators, tachometers and so on - heading 9031. If the ‘test set’ is checking a specific parameter they may be classified elsewhere in an appropriate raised heading in chapter 90. For example, checking voltage 9030. </p><br/><br/><p>Flight simulators are classified in heading 8805. If the simulator is mounted on a motor vehicle, chassis or trailer, then it is classified within heading 8705 or 8716 depending on its specific features or capabilities,see explanatory notes. Parts and accessories of simulators will also be classified, subject to certain important exceptions, within chapter 87 (see notes 2 and 3 to section XVII).</p><br/><br/><p>Printed circuit boards are classified according to what function they perform, or as a part of the machine they are designed for use with.</p><br/><br/><p>Carpets and other floor coverings, of textile or rubber, whether or not cut to shape, are to be classified in chapter 57 (textile) or chapter 40 (rubber).</p><br/><br/><p>Articles that are intended for replenishment of consumable supplies, or to be sold on board for example after shave, perfume and sun creams. are also excluded from classification in this section, and are to classified under their respective headings.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""end-use-relief-provisions-for-civil-aircraft-parts"">End-use relief provisions for civil aircraft parts</h2><br/><br/><p>Importers who wish to take advantage of the end-use relief provisions are required to be authorised by HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=""HM Revenue and Customs"">HMRC</abbr>) before they import or receive goods affected by these provisions. </p><br/><br/><p>Relief from customs duty is provided for:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>civil aircraft (aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the EU member states which carry a military or non-civil registration)</li><br/>  <li>certain goods for use in civil aircraft (including goods for use in ground flying-trainers for civil use) and for incorporation within in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification or conversion</li><br/>  <li>ground flying-trainers and their parts, for civil use</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Relief from customs duties is subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions with a view to customs control of the use of such goods, see Articles 291 to 300 of <a rel=""external"" href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:1993:253:TOC"">Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>An alternative to using end use relief is the certificate of airworthiness scheme.

classifying fruit and nuts for the purposes of the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff) you may come across certain terms and abbreviations. Some common examples are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""common-terms-used"">Common terms used</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>genus - a group of similar plant types, the term forms the first part of the plant’s Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>genera - the plural of genus</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System (<abbr title=""Harmonised System"">HS</abbr>) - classifies a commodity to a particular code so that the correct duties and controls are applied to it on import or export</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Notes"">HSENs</abbr>) - these give useful guidance about the scope of the Tariff chapters, headings and subheadings</li><br/>  <li>oleaginous - oil producing, for example groundnuts</li><br/>  <li>species - a subdivision of a plant genus, it forms the second part of the Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>var. - variety, this indicates a subdivision of a species</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-frozen-fruit-and-nuts"">Classifying frozen fruit and nuts</h2><br/><br/><p>Frozen fruit and nuts are classified under heading code 0811. They can be either uncooked, or cooked by steaming or boiling in water before being frozen. They may have sugar or other sweetening matters added. ‘Frozen’ means that the product has been cooled to below its freezing point until it is frozen throughout.</p><br/><br/><p>If a fruit product covered by chapter 8 is not frozen throughout then it cannot be classified under heading code 0811. Soft frozen or partially frozen fruit must be classified as chilled.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-dried-fruit-and-nuts"">Classifying dried fruit and nuts</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 8 includes dried fruit and nuts. Provided that they still keep the characteristics of dried fruit or dried nuts, these may be partially rehydrated or treated for one of the following purposes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>to preserve or stabilise the product - for example by moderate heat treatment, sulphuring or adding sorbic acid or potassium sorbate</li><br/>  <li>to improve or maintain the product’s appearance - for example by adding vegetable oil or small quantities of glucose syrup</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-frozen-tropical-fruit"">Classifying frozen tropical fruit</h2><br/><br/><p>Subheading codes 0811 90 11, 0811 90 31 and 0811 90 85 refer to tropical fruit.

For classification purposes tropical nuts are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>areca (or betel nut)</li><br/>  <li>Brazil nuts</li><br/>  <li>cashew nuts</li><br/>  <li>coconuts</li><br/>  <li>cola nuts</li><br/>  <li>macadamia nuts</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Fresh or dried tropical nuts that are not mixed are covered under heading codes 0801 or 0802.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-provisionally-preserved-fruit-and-nuts"">Classifying provisionally preserved fruit and nuts</h2><br/><br/><p>Provisionally preserved fruit and nuts are classified under heading code 0812. They must not be suitable for eating immediately. They are generally preserved in a solution like sulphur dioxide gas, brine or sulphur water just for transport and storage purposes before being used in the food industry, mainly for making jam.</p><br/><br/><p>Preserved fruit items that can be eaten immediately, like glace cherries or jam, are not considered to be provisionally preserved and are therefore classified elsewhere, usually

For classification purposes the term ‘wood’ also includes bamboo and other woody materials.</p><br/><br/><p>There are some wood articles which chapter 44 does not cover, such as furniture, toys and other items that have been significantly worked. Items like these are covered in other chapters, according to their use.</p><br/><br/><p>Some articles (though not all) must meet specific size requirements to be classified under certain heading codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Specialist terms are often used to describe both woodworking processes and articles made of wood. Timber and wooden items may be classified according to whether they are, or are made from, coniferous, deciduous or tropical wood.</p><br/><br/><p>For general guidance on wood types, you may also wish to download our glossary of wood and woodworking terms and our glossary of types of wood.</p><br/><br/><section class=""attachment embedded"" id=""attachment_3136544""><br/>  <div class=""attachment-thumb""><br/>      <a aria-hidden=""true"" class=""thumbnail"" href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/14565/Glossary_of_wood_and_woodworking_terms.pdf""><img alt="""" src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/14565/thumbnail_Glossary_of_wood_and_woodworking_terms.pdf.png""></a><br/>  </div><br/>  <div class=""attachment-details""><br/>    <h2 class=""title""><a aria-describedby=""attachment-3136544-accessibility-help"" href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/14565/Glossary_of_wood_and_woodworking_terms.pdf"">Glossary of wood and woodworking terms</a></h2><br/>    <p class=""metadata""><br/>        <span class=""type""><abbr title=""Portable Document Format"">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=""file-size"">241KB</span>, <span class=""page-length"">18 pages</span><br/>    </p><br/><br/><br/>      <div data-module=""toggle"" class=""accessibility-warning"" id=""attachment-3136544-accessibility-help""><br/>        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.<br/>          <a class=""toggler"" href=""#attachment-3136544-accessibility-request"" data-controls=""attachment-3136544-accessibility-request"" data-expanded=""false"">Request an accessible format.</a><br/>        </h2><br/>        <p id=""attachment-3136544-accessibility-request"" class=""js-hidden""><br/>          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a<br/>version of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=""mailto:different.format@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Glossary%20of%20wood%20and%20woodworking%20terms%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Glossary%20of%20wood%20and%20woodworking%20terms%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format"">different.format@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.<br/>Please tell us what format you need.

There’s no limit to the size that fuel wood can be, but it’s generally in the form of short pieces of logs, split logs or billets. Fuel wood may also be in the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>twigs</li><br/>  <li>faggots</li><br/>  <li>rough sticks</li><br/>  <li>vine stems</li><br/>  <li>tree stumps and roots</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Logs used for pulping or for manufacturing matchsticks are not classified as fuel wood. This is because, unlike fuel logs, they’re carefully graded, they may be bark peeled and they’re generally not broken, split, curved, knotty or forked. These logs are classified under heading code 4403.</p><br/><br/><p>Wood in chips or particles is classified under subheading codes 4401 21 and 4401 22. However, the following types of wood are not classified under these subheading codes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>chipwood that’s used for plaiting or making sieves, chip-boxes, pill-boxes and so on - this is classified under heading code 4404</li><br/>  <li>wood shavings that are used in vinegar manufacturing or for clarifying liquids - these are also classified under heading code 4404</li><br/>  <li>wood wool and wood flour - these are classified under heading code 4405</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Wood waste and scrap wood are classified under subheading code 4401 31. They consist of wood that’s not usable as timber and include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>saw mill or planing mill rejects</li><br/>  <li>manufacturing waste</li><br/>  <li>broken planks</li><br/>  <li>old crates</li><br/>  <li>bark and shavings</li><br/>  <li>waste and scrap joinery and carpentry</li><br/>  <li>spent dyewood and tanning wood bark</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Waste and scrap wood are used in particular in paper manufacturing, particle board and fibreboard manufacturing as well as for fuel. All waste and scrap wood that’s intended for use as fuel (regardless of whether it’s been formed into common fuel types like logs, briquettes or pellets) is always classified as waste wood under subheading 4401 31 and never as fuel wood.</p><br/><br/><p>Pulpwood in rounds or quarter split is not classed as waste or scrap wood. Instead it’s classified under heading code 4403.</p><br/><br/><p>Wood charcoal, which is obtained through carbonising wood out of contact with the air, is classified under heading code 4402. This heading code also includes charcoal obtained through carbonising coconut shells, other shells and nuts. Charcoal may be in the form of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>blocks</li><br/>  <li>sticks</li><br/>  <li>granules</li><br/>  <li>powder</li><br/>  <li>briquettes</li><br/>  <li>tablets</li><br/>  <li>balls</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Charcoal that’s agglomerated with tar is also classified under heading code 4402.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-rough-wood-and-roughly-squared-wood"">Classifying rough wood and roughly squared wood</h2><br/><br/><p>Rough wood is timber in its natural, felled state, usually with the branches chopped off.

Wood may be injected or impregnated to preserve it, to make it more durable, to make it fire resistant and to protect it from shrinking. The process may involve the wood being soaked in open vats of hot liquid for a long period and then left in the liquid until it cools. Alternatively the wood can be treated in an autoclave, in a vacuum or under pressure. Treatment products include creosote, dinitrophenols and dinitrocresols.</p><br/><br/><p>Poles made of coniferous wood are often treated in this way and, to be classified under subheading code 4403 11, they must be at least 6 metres long but no longer than 18 metres.

This makes them stronger and easier to fit, unlike the older style, square-edged planks or blocks.</p><br/><br/><p>Original hardwoods such as oak and elm are giving way to cheaper softwood alternatives like pine.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""glossary-of-wood-flooring-terms"">Glossary of wood flooring terms</h2><br/><br/><p>Some of the wood flooring terms used in this guide - and in the Tariff - are listed and explained below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>basket pattern - assembly of fingers, blocks or strips placed edge to edge, to make up a square, the side of which is the same length as the finger, block or strip</li><br/>  <li>brick pattern - parquet made up of pieces of equal length and width, where the end joint is at the centre of the juxtaposed element</li><br/>  <li>engineered wood - layers of hardwood compressed together, like solid wood - it can be sanded and renovated after laying</li><br/>  <li>French flooring - flooring made up of pieces that have a random length and a series of widths, arranged in a parallel direction</li><br/>  <li>herringbone - parquet made up of pieces of the same size, with the ends cut at a right angle, laid perpendicular to one another, at an angle of 45 degrees in relation to the direction of the walls or battens</li><br/>  <li>Hungarian pattern - parquet made up of pieces of the same size, with the ends cut at an angle of 45 and 60 degrees, that are laid end to end at a right angle or at an angle of 120 degrees, forming parallel patterns</li><br/>  <li>laminated - laminated wood should not be confused with laminated plastic or paper - some modern laminated flooring uses a photographic representation of wood on plastic or paper that’s applied to high density fibreboard or a similar product - this type of laminate does not age and usually cannot be sanded and renovated like solid wood</li><br/>  <li>multi-layer flooring - wood flooring with a top layer thickness of at least 2.5 millimetres before installation</li><br/>  <li>parquet - wood flooring with a top layer thickness of at least 2.5 millimetres before installation</li><br/>  <li>parquet panel - pre-assembled laying unit made up from parquet pieces</li><br/>  <li>planking - this is available in various widths, either with tongue and groove in lengths or as plain square-edged planks that simply butt up against one another</li><br/>  <li>solid wood block parquet - uniform brick-like blocks - usually oak - laid in a herringbone, brick, ladder or basket formation</li><br/>  <li>solid wood parquet - made up of different coloured hardwood sections to create decorative patterning - this type of floor is usually allowed to acclimatise to the building where it’s to be laid as the timber’s moisture content can vary,  this causes expansion and contraction so the wood needs time to stabilise</li><br/>  <li>strip pattern - parquet made up of an assembly of equal width but random length strips</li><br/>  <li>veneer - a single thin or fine layer of wood that has been glued to a manufactured base - veneer floors are generally fitted ‘floating’, which means they’re not fixed to a sub-floor, they lie on a foam or cork underlay and must have a flat, even surface beneath them</li><br/>  <li>wood block - floors made up from small strips or blocks of wood, around three inches wide and nine inches long, arranged in herringbone, basket-weave and other geometric patterns</li><br/>  <li>wood laminate - has thin layers of wood that are glued to a manufactured base</li><br/>  <li>wood planks - come in long lengths with widths of 4 inches (or 10 centimetres) or more</li><br/>  <li>wood strip - boards are narrower and shorter than planks and have up to 3 strips of wood per board</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-44"">What’s not covered in chapter 44</h2><br/><br/><p>The following items are not covered in chapter 44:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>wood in chips and similar forms, used mainly in perfumes and pharmaceutical products or in insecticides and fungicides -

Long grains of brown rice tend to be less fluffy and tender, and short grains less sticky.  Brown rice also takes about twice as long to cook and has a much shorter shelf life (because of the oil in the germ). </p><br/><br/><p>Examples of rice falling within this definition are those with the commercial descriptions ‘brown rice’, ‘cargo rice’, ‘loonzain’ and ‘riso sabamato’. Husked brown rice (cargo rice) which although the husk has been removed by mechanical hullers, is still enclosed in the pericarp. Husked rice almost always still contains a small quantity of paddy.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""semi-milled-or-wholly-milled-rice-whether-or-not-polished-or-glazed"">1006 30 - Semi-milled or wholly milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed</h3><br/><br/><p>Rice can also be milled to remove the pericarp (the outer layer of the rice which is still present in brown rice). Rice of this sort has either been semi-milled or wholly milled (also referred to as bleached rice).</p><br/><br/><p>Semi-milled rice consists of rice from which the husk, part of the germ and the whole or part of the outer layers of the pericarp, but not the inner layers, have been removed.</p><br/><br/><p>Wholly milled rice consists of whole rice from which the pericarp has been completely removed by passage through special tapering cylinders. Wholly milled rice can also be polished and subsequently glazed in order to improve its appearance. The polishing process (which is designed to embellish the mat surface of the plain milled rice is carried out in brush machines or ‘polishing cones’. Glazing consists of coating the grains with a mixture of glucose and talcum in special glazing drums. The heading also includes ‘Camolino’ rice, which consists of milled rice coated with a film of oil.</p><br/><br/><p>Rice can also be referred to as parboiled. This means that the grains of rice, whilst still in the husk and before any other process has been carried out (eg husking, milling, etc), has been soaked in hot water or steamed and then dried. The grain structure of parboiled rice is only modified to a minor extent by the process it has undergone and is not classed as cooked rice. Such rice, after milling, polishing, etc, takes from 20 to 35 minutes to cook fully. Parboiled rice is usually puffed in appearance.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""broken-rice"">1006 40 - Broken rice</h3><br/><br/><p>Broken rice is damaged white rice, broken during processing. During the milling process grain fragments, the length of which does not exceed three quarters of the average length of the whole grain, are separated from the white rice, whose shape remains intact. This is classed as broken rice. A grain of broken rice gives a low fibre texture and low nutrient level, while retaining its high energy. Broken rice contains more grain fragments within the grain. This type of rice is of a lower quality and is usually used for baby formulas, rice cereals, pet foods, rice wine and rice flour, as well as pre-package or canned goods.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""exclusions-from-1006"">Exclusions from 1006</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading 1006 only includes rice in an uncooked and unprocessed state. This means that products from the milling of rice are excluded and are classified in chapter 11.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading 1006 also excludes rice which has been submitted to a treatment which has considerably modified the grain structure. Pre-cooked rice consisting of worked grains which have been either fully or partially cooked and then dehydrated fall in heading 1904. Partially pre-cooked rice takes 5 to 12 minutes to prepare for consumption, whereas fully pre-cooked rice needs only to be soaked in water and brought to the boil before consumption. ‘Puffed’ rice obtained by the swelling process and ready for consumption is also classified in heading 1904.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-the-size-of-the-grain-of-rice"">Classifying the size of the grain of rice</h2><br/><br/><p>Rice is generally classified according to the size of the grain. The length to width ratio of the grain size is also taken into account. To calculate this, divide the average length of the grain by the average width. Alternatively, arrange four pieces of rice. If the piece along the top is shorter than the other three then the length/width ration equals less than three, if it is the same length or longer then the length/width ration will be equal or greater than three.</p><br/><br/><p>Short grain rice (also referred to as round) is almost round, with moist grains that stick together when cooked and is generally used for making rice puddings and the like. This type of rice has grains which are of a length not exceeding 5.2mm and of a length/width ratio of less than 2. Short grain rice has a short, plump, almost round kernel.</p><br/><br/><p>Medium grain rice is shorter and plumper and works well in dishes such as Paella and Risotto. This type of rice has grains of which are of a length exceeding 5.2mm but not exceeding 6.0mm and of a length/width ratio of less than 3.</p><br/><br/><p>Long grain rice is long and slender, the grains stay separate after cooking. This type of rice, the grains of which are of a length exceeding 6.0mm.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-cooked-rice"">Classifying cooked rice</h2><br/><br/><p>Cooked rice dishes are classified under heading 1904. The following are some examples of products included.</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (72%), chicken meat (20%), a mixture of spices (7%), lemon grass (0.5%) and anchovy extract (0.5%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (65%), chicken meat (14%), a mixture of spices (13.2%), aubergines (3%), basil (2.5%) and anchovy extract (2.3%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (65.4%), chicken meat (15.5%), potatoes (10%), a mixture of spices (7.1%) and anchovy extract (2%).</p><br/><br/><p>Ready-made meals, consisting of the following two individually packed components, put up in a set for retail sale: (a) pre-cooked rice (150g), and (b) curry (200g) consisting of coconut milk (50%), beef (20%), potatoes (15%), a mixture of spices (7%), groundnuts (3%), anchovy extract (3%) and onions (2%).</p><br/><br/><p>Microwaveable instant fried rice, with green curry and meat. Ingredients include instant rice, meat (16%), seasoning pack.</p><br/><br/><p>If a ready-made rice-based meal contains more than 20% of any kind of meat, fish, crustacean or mollusc (calculated as a percentage of the whole dish) it should be classified as a preparation of that meat or fish in chapter 16.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""types-varieties-and-forms-of-rice"">Types, varieties and forms of rice</h2><br/><br/><p>There are many varieties of rice now available, ranging from the familiar white or brown long-grain rice to speciality ones such as basmati and the so-called glutinous rice used in Japanese cooking to make sushi. Rice is also marketed in a variety of convenience packs. Some of these are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""della-delrose-and-delmont"">Della, Delrose, and Delmont</h3><br/><p>These varieties combine the qualities of regular long grain rice and basmati rice. They have an aroma similar to basmati. However, cooked grains swell in both length and width, like regular long grain rice.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""black-japonica"">Black Japonica</h3><br/><p>This is an aromatic rice with a dark black bran. Like brown rice, it is minimally processed to retain its bran layers and takes 45 to 50 minutes to prepare. Cooked grains are slightly chewy with a subtle sweet spiciness.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""brown-long-grain-rice"">Brown long-grain rice</h3><br/><p>This rice retains the natural bran layer which is rich in many vitamins and minerals, including rice bran oil. This long-grain rice is firm in texture, with a slightly nutty flavour.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""white-long-grain-rice"">White long-grain rice</h3><br/><p>Long-grain rice is the separating grain which is delicious in the many international dishes of Asia, India and Spain.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""white-medium-grain-rice"">White medium-grain rice</h3><br/><p>Better known as Risotto or Arborio rice, this is the softer cooking medium-grain rice which has the advantage of being able to carry flavours and colours well. Its soft, creamy texture makes it ideal for desserts such as creamy rice pudding. It absorbs as much as five times its weight in liquid.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""arborio-rice"">Arborio rice</h3><br/><p>A type of short-grain rice traditionally grown in Italy and used to make risotto. The high starch content of Arborio rice gives risotto its characteristic creamy texture.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""easy-cook-long-grain-white-or-brown-rice"">Easy cook long-grain white or brown rice</h3><br/><p>Sometimes called parboiled or pre-fluffed rice. It is steamed under pressure before milling which hardens the grain, reducing the possibility of over-cooking. This process also helps to retain much of the natural vitamin and mineral content.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""jasmine-or-thai-fragrant-rice"">Jasmine or Thai fragrant rice</h3><br/><p>This long-grain white rice has a delicate Jasmine fragrance which makes it perfect for inclusion in Asian dishes and with curries and seafood. A long-grain variety popular in Thailand and appreciated for its sweet aroma and nutty flavour. It’s used as a cheap substitute for Basmati rice.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""kalijira-rice"">Kalijira rice</h3><br/><p>This tiny aromatic rice is grown in Bangladesh, cooks fast and is especially used in rice puddings.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""basmati"">Basmati</h3><br/><p>A variety of long grain rice. It is an aromatic, fragrant and slender, and is a non-glutinous rice. When cooked it swells only lengthwise, resulting in long slender grains that are very dry, light and separate not sticky. Pakistan and India are the largest cultivators and exporters of rice; it is primarily grown through paddy field farming in the Punjab region. The grains of Basmati are longer than most other types of rice. Cooked grains of Basmati rice are characteristically free flowing rather than sticky. As with most long grain rice, cooked Basmati rice can be uniquely identified by its fragrance. Basmati rice is available as either white or brown. The approved varieties of Basmati rice are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Basmati 370</li><br/>  <li>Basmati 386 (India)</li><br/>  <li>Type-3 (Dehradun India)</li><br/>  <li>Taraori Basmati (HBC-19 India)</li><br/>  <li>Basmati 217 (India)</li><br/>  <li>Ranbir Basmati (India)</li><br/>  <li>Kernel (Basmati Pakistan)</li><br/>  <li>Pusa Basmati</li><br/>  <li>Super Basmati</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""wild-rice"">Wild rice</h3><br/><br/><p>A tall aquatic grass of North America with a grain which is two or more times the length of the long grain rice varieties of Asia (Oryza). The name wild rice is misleading because it actually the seed of a type of wild grass (zinania aquatica) which grows in the shallow lake area of North America. Its long slender seeds are dark brown which turn purple when cooked. Despite of its name it is not related to domesticated rice (oryza).</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

adults or children, are under subheadings of heading code 9503. Toys intended for animals, including pets, are classified in their own appropriate heading.</p><br/><br/><p>The classification listings are quite detailed to cover the majority of specific commodities.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tricycles-scooters-pedal-cars-and-similar-toys"">Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar toys</h3><br/><br/><p>In classification terms, these are restricted to wheeled toys designed to be driven by children and powered or propelled by the children themselves using pedals, hand levers or motors.</p><br/><br/><p>The key heading code for these items is 9503 00 10 and includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>childrens tricycles and similar items, but bear in mind bicycles for children are classified as bicycles, using heading code 8712</li><br/>  <li>scooters designed to be ridden by children</li><br/>  <li>pedal or hand-propelled wheeled toys in the form of animals</li><br/>  <li>pedal cars or motorised cars, often in the form of miniature sports cars, jeeps or lorries</li><br/>  <li>wheeled toys propelled by hand levers</li><br/>  <li>other wheeled toys drawn or pushed and large enough for children to ride in</li><br/>  <li>childrens cars powered by a motor</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Practical devices for children to sit in, such as baby walkers, are not classed as toys - a different chapter using heading code 9403 covers these.</p><br/><br/><p>Other items excepted include those without wheels, such as rocking horses, which we classify under heading code 9503 00 41. They’re usually stuffed and represent animals.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""dolls-representing-humans-their-parts-and-accessories"">Dolls representing humans, their parts and accessories</h3><br/><br/><p>Dolls are generally covered by 2 heading codes. Dolls themselves under 9503 00 21, and their parts and accessories under 9503 00 29.</p><br/><br/><p>These heading codes cover dolls used as toys by adults or children. It includes dolls used for decorative purposes, such as mascot dolls or boudoir dolls.</p><br/><br/><p>A plastic doll with movable limbs filled with sweets would come under subheading 9503 00 21, as in EC Regulation 41/2013. Remember that dolls only representing humans are covered by these classification codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Dolls representing non-human figures, for example, robots, devils or angels, are classified under heading codes 9503 00 41 or 9503 00 49. Read the information on general toys below for more details.</p><br/><br/><p>Parts and accessories covered by 9503 00 29 include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>heads</li><br/>  <li>bodies</li><br/>  <li>limbs</li><br/>  <li>eyes (other than those unmounted on the dolls and made of glass, which are classified under heading code 7018)</li><br/>  <li>moving mechanisms for eyes</li><br/>  <li>voice-producing mechanisms</li><br/>  <li>wigs</li><br/>  <li>dolls’ clothing, shoes and hats</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>There are some specific commodities that are covered by different heading codes.</p><br/><br/><p>Musical boxes with a doll attached are classified under heading code 9208.</p><br/><br/><p>Tin soldiers without moving parts or removable clothing are classified under heading code 9503 00 85. This is because they’re die-cast models made of metal, rather than dolls.</p><br/><br/><p>Larger figures used for shop window displays have their own heading code of 9618.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""general-toys"">General toys</h3><br/><br/><p>Train sets and scale model assembly kits are classified under heading code 9503 00 30. This includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>trains</li><br/>  <li>tracks</li><br/>  <li>signals</li><br/>  <li>planes</li><br/>  <li>boats</li><br/>  <li>vehicles</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Construction kits, such as building blocks of plastic, are covered by heading code 9503 00 35.</p><br/><br/><p>The key point of difference for these 2 classifications is that if the toy kit is designed to be permanently assembled, such as a model car or aeroplane kit, it’ll be classified in the former heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s designed to be constructed and deconstructed, like plastic building blocks, it’ll be classified under the latter category.</p><br/><br/><p>Toys and other play items representing non-human figures are covered by heading codes 9503 00 41 if they’re stuffed, and 9503 00 49 if they’re not stuffed.</p><br/><br/><p>Toy musical instruments are classified under heading code 9503 00 55. These are distinguished from ‘full’ musical instruments by having limited capabilities - for example, an inability to produce the range of notes of its adult counterpart. Electrically operated instruments, such as organs, are also classified here.</p><br/><br/><p>Toy musical apparatus, such as childrens record players or CD players that play rigid plastic discs rather than standard records or CDs, are also covered in this heading code, as are toy musical boxes and other items that have a wind-up mechanism and play a limited range of tunes.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading codes 9503 00 61 and 9503 00 69 cover puzzles of all types, including jigsaws, sliders or Rubik’s cubes.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-toys-put-up-in-sets-or-outfits-under-subheading-9503-00-70"">Other toys put up in sets or outfits under subheading 9503 00 70</h3><br/><br/><p>‘Sets’ of this subheading consist of 2 or more different types of articles (mainly for amusement), put up in the same packing for retail sale without repacking.</p><br/><br/><p>Articles of the same subheading, except for items covered by subheadings 9503 00 95 or 9503 00 99 (as these subheadings may include miscellaneous articles of different types), are not to be considered different types of articles.</p><br/><br/><p>Apart from the articles forming a set, simple accessories or objects of minor importance intended to be used with the articles (for example, a plastic carrot or a plastic brush for a toy animal) can be present.</p><br/><br/><p>By virtue of Note 4 to Chapter 95, this subheading includes sets intended for the amusement of children, consisting of articles of heading 9503 combined with one or more items which, if presented separately, would be classified in other headings, provided that the combinations have the essential character of toys.</p><br/><br/><p>Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>sets consisting of toys in the form of injection moulds and moulds for modelling pastes together with other items such as tubes or tablets of paint, modelling pastes, pencils and chalks</li><br/>  <li>cosmetic sets for children containing articles of heading 9503 combined with preparations of heading 3304</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, cosmetic sets for children containing preparations of heading 3304 which do not contain any articles of heading 9503 are not included (heading 3304).</p><br/><br/><p>‘Outfits’ of this subheading consist of 2 or more different articles put up in the same packing for retail sale, without repacking, and are specific to a particular type of recreation, work, person or profession, such as instructional and educational toys.</p><br/><br/><p>Outfits would not include textile items of fancy dress. These would be classified according to the material from which they’re made - see Section XI (Chapter 61 or Chapter 62).</p><br/><br/><p>Toy weapons, such as guns, rifles, swords and water pistols are under heading code 9503 00 81.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading codes 9503 00 85, 9503 00 95 and 9503 00 99 cover a wide variety of toys not covered specifically elsewhere including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>toy balloons</li><br/>  <li>toy kites</li><br/>  <li>toy tools and implements</li><br/>  <li>magic lanterns</li><br/>  <li>toy spectacles and sunglasses without prescription lenses or UV protection</li><br/>  <li>toy counting frames</li><br/>  <li>toy sewing machines</li><br/>  <li>toy clocks and watches</li><br/>  <li>toy walkie talkies</li><br/>  <li>toy play tents</li><br/>  <li>hoops and toy skipping ropes (skipping ropes intended for physical exercise are covered under heading code 9506)</li><br/>  <li>marbles</li><br/>  <li>toy money boxes</li><br/>  <li>babies’ rattles</li><br/>  <li>jack-in-the-boxes</li><br/>  <li>toy theatres</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-games"">Classifying games</h2><br/><br/><p>Most games are classified under the heading codes 9504 and 9505.

Not only is the great city of Glasgow hosting the Commonwealth Games, but also the Glasgow Grand Prix as well - and the UK government will do its part to make sure both are great sporting events.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The tax exemption the Treasury is announcing will extend the cultural and economic contribution that the Games will bring. It will also ensure Scotland continues to attract the highest standard of athletes.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, added:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">While athletes for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will compete with one another at the Commonwealth Games, the whole of the United Kingdom wants Glasgow 2014 to be a great success. By offering this additional tax break, we hope to ensure that the best athletes will come to Glasgow this summer for both this event and the Games itself.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Lord Smith of Kelvin, Chairman of  Glasgow 2014 said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>Having this Grand Prix event in Glasgow and Scotland for the first time provides an  international showcase for Hampden Park, Scotland’s national stadium, our Commonwealth Games venue for Athletics – as well as the great global athletes who will come to compete.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Glasgow 2014 warmly welcomes this positive contribution from UK government which will play a key role in maximising opportunities to engage the Commonwealth’s elite international athletes in what will be an exciting build-up to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, the UK’s next big sporting event.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>The one-off exemption will apply to all non-UK resident accredited competitors in the event to encourage more world-class international athletes to compete in the event, and has been granted on an exceptional basis.</p><br/><br/><p>It will not apply to any officials, sponsors, coaching staff or UK resident athletes who will continue to be liable to UK tax on any income which is related to their participation in the event. The exemption will not cover any other taxes such as corporation tax or VAT.</p><br/><br/><p>As announced in January 2012, a similar income tax exemption will also be provided for accredited competitors in the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games, which is intended to help spread the Olympic legacy into Scotland and encourage top athletes to compete at the Commonwealth Games.</p><br/><br/><p>Image by <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/12648913@N02/3488695540/sizes/o/in/photolist-6jhtD7-6wzo9V-6yjxbP-6yjxKv-6yoG1G-6yoGym-6yoGNS-6yoHpb-6yoHWS-6G8ytk-b8ZV9D-b8ZWNn-b8ZXya-b8ZXbX-g4TdDv-85bb9T-gM3K7m-8Zqnog-e8PKVA-8Zsmn9-idHLNv-idHypx-idGULP-idHpHN-idHif5-idHLSD-idHg53-idHvty-idHrWW-d4xK1U-d4xKuQ-gJujpU-ceQ8Q9-ceQa1j-ceQ9eu-aE6tbb-d7WVJw-8YxPHT-dTa28o-8YCK9h-8YGzGa-8ZrTip-8YHEcv-8YBr7W-e8Pw75-8YJT5p-8YMpQo-8YKESw-8YMLhQ-8YTJXZ-e8JxpP/"">Sandeep Sajjala on Flickr</a>.

Some common examples are listed below:</p><br/><br/><p>Common terms used</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>alliaceous vegetables - vegetables that belong to the Allium plant family (see below)</li><br/>  <li>Allium - vegetables in the Allium family which include onions, shallots, leeks and garlic</li><br/>  <li>Brassica - vegetables in the brassica family which include cabbages, kale, brussels sprouts and cauliflowers</li><br/>  <li>Genus - group of similar plant types - the term forms the first part of the plant’s Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>Genera - plural of genus</li><br/>  <li>HS - Harmonised System that classifies commodities under different codes so that the correct duties and controls are applied to imports and exports</li><br/>  <li>HSENs - Harmonised System Explanatory Notes - these give useful guidance about the scope of the Tariff chapters, headings and subheadings</li><br/>  <li>leguminous vegetables - vegetables that belong to the Leguminosae plant family (see below)</li><br/>  <li>Leguminosae - vegetables in the Leguminosae family groupings include peas (pisum), beans (phaseolus and vigna) and lentils (lens)</li><br/>  <li>species - subdivision of a plant family or genus - it forms the second part of the Latin or botanical name</li><br/>  <li>var. - variety, this indicates a subdivision of a species</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-frozen-vegetables"">Classifying frozen vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Frozen vegetables are classified under heading code 0710. They can be either uncooked, or cooked by steaming or boiling in water before being frozen.</p><br/><br/><p>Frozen vegetables must be maintained at a temperature of no more than -12°C. This must be consistent throughout the product, to make sure it’s thoroughly frozen right the way through.</p><br/><br/><p>If a frozen product is not frozen down to -12°C then it cannot be classified under heading code 0710. It must be classified as fresh or chilled. In particular, products described as ‘frozen garlic’ must be classified under heading code 0703 (fresh or chilled) if they do not meet the freezing temperature requirement.</p><br/><br/><p>As well as the types of vegetable specifically listed under subheading codes 0710 10 to 0710 90, the following are also classified under heading code 0710, if frozen to the required temperature:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>truffles</li><br/>  <li>capers</li><br/>  <li>marrows and pumpkins</li><br/>  <li>aubergines</li><br/>  <li>fennel and cress</li><br/>  <li>certain herbs, such as parsley and chervil</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-roots-and-tubers"">Classifying roots and tubers</h2><br/><br/><p>Certain roots and tubers with a high starch or inulin content are classified under heading code 0714. (Inulin is a naturally occurring carbohydrate that is extracted from certain roots). Products that are classified under this heading include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>manioc (or cassava)</li><br/>  <li>sweet potatoes</li><br/>  <li>Jerusalem artichokes</li><br/>  <li>arrowroot</li><br/>  <li>salep (flour made from the dried roots of orchids)</li><br/>  <li>sago pith</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products may be with or without skin. They can be fresh, chilled, frozen or dried, and may be whole, sliced or in pellet form. Subheading code 0714 10 00 91 covers pellets of manioc flour and meal. When dispersed in water, at least 95 per cent by weight of the pellet - calculated on the dry matter - must pass through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with a mesh size of 2 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""chinese-water-chestnuts"">Chinese water chestnuts</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading code 0714 also covers Chinese water chestnuts (tuberous roots of Eleocharis dulcis or Eleocharis tuberosa). Although they do not have a high starch content, they are included here because of their high inulin content. But the Caltrop variety of water chestnuts (nut-like fruit of Trapa natans) is classified as nuts in Chapter 8 under heading code 0802.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-leguminous-vegetables"">Classifying leguminous vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Leguminous vegetables are classified under heading code 0708 if they’re fresh or chilled, and under heading code 0713 if they’re dried. Dried products are included whether they’re intended for food use or for sowing.</p><br/><br/><p>Leguminous vegetables classified under these headings include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>peas (pisum sativum)</li><br/>  <li>beans (vigna, phaseolus species)</li><br/>  <li>broad beans and horse beans (vicia faba)</li><br/>  <li>chickpeas (garbanzos)</li><br/>  <li>lentils (lens)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Some legumes are not covered in Chapter 7 and are classified elsewhere. For example, soya beans are classified in Chapter 12 under heading code 1201. Locust beans are classified in the same chapter, under heading code 1212.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-provisionally-preserved-vegetables"">Classifying provisionally preserved vegetables</h2><br/><br/><p>Provisionally preserved vegetables are classified under heading code 0711. They must not be suitable for eating immediately. They’re generally packed in casks or barrels and are raw ingredients that have been provisionally preserved for transport and storage before being used in food manufacturing. They must stay in that state and remain unsuitable for immediate consumption.</p><br/><br/><p>So vegetables such as olives or gherkins that have been pickled in brine or vinegar and can be eaten straight from the jar are not provisionally preserved and are classified elsewhere. If they can be eaten with no further treatment or processing they’re classified in Chapter 20 under heading codes 2001, 2002, 2003 or 2005.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-herbs-and-spices"">Classifying herbs and spices</h2><br/><br/><p>There is no single classification in the Tariff for herbs. They can be covered in Chapter 7, Chapter 9 or Chapter 12, depending on their purpose and on the part of the plant they come from. For example, leaves are classified in a different chapter from seeds.</p><br/><br/><p>Some herbs are classified as vegetables and are covered under heading codes 0709 to 0712 in chapter 7. They include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>parsley</li><br/>  <li>chervil</li><br/>  <li>tarragon </li><br/>  <li>coriander leaves </li><br/>  <li>dill leaves </li><br/>  <li>sweet marjoram</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Some herbs are classified as spices and are covered in Chapter 9. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>thyme</li><br/>  <li>bay leaves</li><br/>  <li>dill seed</li><br/>  <li>coriander seed</li><br/>  <li>cumin seed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Chapter 12 covers herbs that are classified under heading code 1211 as types of plant used in perfumery, in pharmacy, or for insecticidal, fungicidal or similar purposes. These include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>basil</li><br/>  <li>borage</li><br/>  <li>hyssop</li><br/>  <li>mint</li><br/>  <li>rosemary</li><br/>  <li>rue</li><br/>  <li>ginseng roots</li><br/>  <li>sage</li><br/>  <li>wild marjoram (oregano)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Many of these herbs are also used in cooking, but they can never be classified in Chapter 7 as vegetables. They must always be classified under heading code 1211.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifications-and-latin-names-for-edible-vegetables"">Classifications and Latin names for edible vegetables</h2><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Common Name</th><br/>      <th>Alternatives</th><br/>      <th>Latin Name</th><br/>      <th>Heading Code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Artichoke -

It has a shiny mirror-like surface. The varnish or lacquer used can be pigmented or non-pigmented and may be based on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>vegetable oil that dries and hardens - linseed oil is normally used</li><br/>  <li>cellulose derivatives like nitro-cellulose</li><br/>  <li>synthetic products (including thermoplastics) - polyurethane plastics are normally used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If preformed plastic sheet is used to coat the leather, it’s usually made from polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>).</p><br/><br/><p>The surface of patent leather is not necessarily smooth. It could be embossed, maybe to imitate crocodile skin, or artificially crushed, crinkled or grained. But it must still have a shiny mirror-like finish.</p><br/><br/><p>To be classified as patent leather, the thickness of the coating or sheet must not be more than 0.15 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather that is coated with pigmented paint or lacquer to give it a metallic sheen. These paints and lacquers consist of pigments like mica, silica and similar flakes in a binding substance like vegetable oil that dries and hardens, or plastic. Leather that’s been treated like this is known as ‘imitation metallised leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent laminated leather is leather that’s been coated with a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres but less than half the total thickness of the finished material. It has the same mirror-like finish as patent leather and is sometimes known as ‘patent coated leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>If the leather has been covered by a sheet of preformed plastic that is thicker than 0.15 millimetres, but more than half the total thickness of the finished material, then it’s covered in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-saddlery-and-other-equipment-for-animals"">Classifying saddlery and other equipment for animals</h2><br/><br/><p>Saddlery and other equipment for animals are classified under heading code 4201.

The chapter is divided into sub-chapters I to XIII.</p><br/><br/><p>There are certain items that are specifically excluded from chapter 29 and classified in other chapters. These include products such as vitamins put up as food supplements, and compounds, such as paracetamol, intended for use as a medicament.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""chapter-29-heading-codes-quick-reference-table"">Chapter 29 heading codes: quick reference table</h2><br/><br/><p>This chapter covers organic chemicals. It also covers organic chemicals that are dissolved in water, or contain certain permitted additives.</p><br/><br/><p>The following list is not exhaustive, but it will help you check whether or not a particular item is likely to be covered in this chapter. For more detail, the European Customs Inventory of Chemicals (<abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr>) database can help you identify the right heading code for the chemicals covered in this chapter.</p><br/><br/><table><br/>  <thead><br/>    <tr><br/>      <th>Item</th><br/>      <th>Heading code</th><br/>    </tr><br/>  </thead><br/>  <tbody><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Antibiotics</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Hormones</td><br/>      <td>2937</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Organo-sulphur compounds</td><br/>      <td>2930</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Organo-inorganic compounds</td><br/>      <td>2931</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Paracetamol</td><br/>      <td>2924</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Provitamins</td><br/>      <td>2936</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Streptomycin</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Tetracycline</td><br/>      <td>2941</td><br/>    </tr><br/>    <tr><br/>      <td>Vitamins</td><br/>      <td>2936</td><br/>    </tr><br/>  </tbody><br/></table><br/><br/><p>This guidance covers the classification of separate chemically defined organic compounds (with or without impurities) in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff). They can be dissolved in water or if allowable in some other solvent, and contain certain permitted additives. They must be intended for general rather than specific use. For example, paracetamol in bulk is covered in this chapter, but if paracetamol is packaged as a medicament then it’s covered elsewhere. For help with classifying chemicals that are made up into measured doses or intended for retail sale, you can read the guide on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/classifying-pharmaceutical-products"">classifying pharmaceutical products</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>For detailed information on this sector, read the guide on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/chemicals"">chemicals</a>.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""defining-organic-chemicals"">Defining organic chemicals</h2><br/><br/><p>When you are classifying organic chemicals for the purposes of the Tariff you may come across certain terms and abbreviations. Some common examples are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""common-terms-used"">Common terms used</h3><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Chemical Abstracts Service Registration Number (<abbr title=""Chemical Abstracts Service Registration Number"">CAS RN</abbr>) - a unique number allocated to a chemical by the American Chemical Society and used worldwide.</li><br/>  <li>Customs Union and Statistics number (<abbr title=""Customs Union and Statistics number"">CUS</abbr>).</li><br/>  <li>European Customs Inventory of Chemicals (<abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr>) - database containing details of the correct Tariff classification of both inorganic and organic chemicals.</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System (HS) - classifies commodities under different codes so that the correct duties and controls are applied to imports and exports.</li><br/>  <li>Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Notes"">HSENs</abbr>) - these give useful guidance about the scope of the Tariff chapters, headings and subheadings.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""permitted-additives-when-classifying-organic-chemicals"">Permitted additives when classifying organic chemicals</h2><br/><br/><p>As a general rule, chapter 29 is restricted to separate chemically defined organic compounds, subject to the provisions of note 1 to the chapter. To be covered in this chapter they must comply with strict conditions that specify which additives are allowed. These conditions are set out in Note 1a to Note 1g to chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><p>Compounds can be dissolved in water or in some other solvent. In the latter case, the solution must constitute a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and not to render the product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use. Stabilisers such as anti-caking agents can also be added, but only to preserve or transport the compound.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if an essential trace element such as chromium picolinate is prepared as a dietary supplement in the form of tablets or capsules, it would not be covered in this chapter. This is because the added ingredients, such as binder, the capsule shell and excipients, have not been added just to preserve or transport it. This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under code heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2936 specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>provitamins</li><br/>  <li>vitamins</li><br/>  <li>derivatives used mainly as vitamins</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of provitamins, vitamins and vitamin derivatives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Certain specified additives, such as anti-oxidants, are allowed so long as the amount added is just enough to preserve or transport the vitamins. However, vitamins put up in capsules for use as dietary supplements are not covered here. This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under code heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-organic-chemicals-and-suitability-for-general-use"">Classifying organic chemicals and suitability for general use</h2><br/><br/><p>When you classify a product in chapter 29 it’s important to ensure that anything added to a compound does not make the resulting product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use. For example vitamins and provitamins are normally covered under code heading 2936, but if they’re prepared as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules or caplets then they cannot be classified under this code heading. Because of the way they’re presented, with an intended daily dosage, they’re considered to be suitable for a specific use.</p><br/><br/><p>These types of product are also excluded from this code heading because the additives are used to do more than just preserve or transport the vitamins - they’re added to make the product convenient and easy to use.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-antibiotics"">Classifying antibiotics</h2><br/><br/><p>Antibiotics, such as penicillins and streptomycins, are classified under code heading 2941. This code heading covers compounds that have an antibiotic activity. They are substances produced by micro-organisms that can destroy or stop the growth of other micro-organisms. Substances that have low antibiotic activity are not covered under this code heading but are classified elsewhere in chapter 29, depending on their chemical structure.</p><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2941 also excludes certain other antibiotic products. Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>antibiotics that are intended to treat or prevent a disease or ailment (these are covered in chapter 30 under code heading 3003 or code heading 3004, depending on how they’re presented)</li><br/>  <li>antibiotic preparations of a kind used in animal feeding, ie a combination of a dried antibiotic with, for example, a cereal product - the antibiotic content is usually between 8% and 16% (these preparations are covered in chapter 23 under code heading 2309)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-organic-chemicals-and-chapter-notes-2-to-8"">Classifying organic chemicals and chapter Notes 2 to 8</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 29 has detailed notes to help with classifying chemicals. The guidance given in note 2 to note 8 provides information on certain specific chemicals and how to deal with certain classification issues.</p><br/><br/><p>A summary of these notes is included below:</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-2"">Note 2</h3><br/><br/><p>Exclusions of certain organic chemicals from chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-3"">Note 3</h3><br/><br/><p>Advises how to deal with organic chemicals that could be classified in two or more of the headings of chapter 29.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-4"">Note 4</h3><br/><br/><p>Any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives under the following code headings includes a reference to compound derivatives in each case:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>code heading 2904 to 2906</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2908 to 2911</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2913 to 2920</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>This Note also gives guidance on the interpretation of ‘nitrogen-functions’ and ‘oxygen-functions’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-5"">Note 5</h3><br/><br/><p>Note 5 covers a number of different compounds:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Note 5(A) and Note 5(B) give guidance on the correct code heading for classifying esters</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(C) (1) and (2) deal with salts of organic compounds</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(C) (3) covers co-ordination compounds</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(D) requires metal alcoholates to be classified under the same code heading as the corresponding alcohols - except in the case of ethanol (heading 2905)</li><br/>  <li>Note 5(E) covers halides of carboxylic acids</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-6"">Note 6</h3><br/><br/><p>This Note clarifies what is and what is not included under:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>code heading 2930 organo-sulphur compounds</li><br/>  <li>code heading 2931 other organo-inorganic compounds</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-7"">Note 7</h3><br/><br/><p>Code headings 2932, 2933 and 2934 do not include certain specific compounds. Note 7 lists the exclusions.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""note-8"">Note 8</h3><br/><br/><p>Code heading 2937 covers hormones. Note 8 explains what the term ‘hormone’ includes and to what it applies.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""whats-not-covered-in-chapter-29"">What’s not covered in chapter 29</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 29 covers separately defined organic compounds, provided they only contain certain permitted additives or they’re intended for a general - rather than a specific - use. Chemicals that do not meet these requirements are covered elsewhere. Some examples of products this chapter does not cover:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Compounds, such as paracetamol, put up as a medicament. These are covered in chapter 30.</li><br/>  <li>Disinfectants intended for retail sale or as preparations or articles. These are covered in chapter 38 under heading code 3808.</li><br/>  <li>Vitamins put up as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules, caplets and so on which have a recommended daily dosage. These are considered to be suitable for a specific use so they’re covered elsewhere. Many are covered in chapter 21 under heading code 2106. For more information on food supplements and dietary preparations, read our guide to classifying herbal medicines, supplements, tonics.</li><br/>  <li>Products that contain more ingredients than just the additives permitted for preserving or transporting the compound. These include vitamins mixed with other organic chemicals, or with minerals, herbs, other parts of plants, food ingredients and similar substances. This type of product is generally covered in chapter 21 or chapter 22, depending on its actual ingredients and the way it’s presented. For example, tonic drinks containing vitamins and other ingredients and intended for immediate consumption are covered in chapter 22.</li><br/>  <li>Feed supplements for animals that contain vitamins and other ingredients - such as cereals and proteins. These are covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309.</li><br/>  <li>Antibiotics intended for therapeutic or prophylactic uses. These are covered in chapter 30 under heading code 3003 or heading code 3004, depending on how they’re presented. You can read our guide to classifying pharmaceutical products for help with classifying chemicals that are made up into measured doses or intended for retail sale.</li><br/>  <li>Antibiotic preparations used in animal feeding - for example a dried antibiotic mass on a carrier like cereal middlings. The antibiotic content is usually between 8% and 16%. This type of preparation is covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309.</li><br/>  <li>Products that have been produced as part of the antibiotics manufacturing process and are intended to be processed further. These are covered in Chapter 38 under heading code 3824 (they’re referred to as ‘intermediate products’).</li><br/>  <li>Certain chemicals, such as crude glycerol, are specifically excluded from this chapter and are classified elsewhere. These chemicals are listed in Note 2a to Note 2k to chapter 29.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""chapter-notes"">Chapter notes</h3><br/><p>Section VI of the Tariff, which includes chapter 29, has detailed notes covering the products classified in this chapter. Chapter 29 also has its own classification notes. When classifying organic chemicals, you should refer to these notes for specific guidance.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""combined-products-or-sets"">Combined products (or sets)</h3><br/><p>Some products are made up by combining two or more separate elements, or constituents. Some or all of these constituents may be covered in Section VI as products of the chemical or allied industries. They are intended to be mixed together to produce a product that’s covered either in Section VI or in Section VII. These combined products, or sets, are classified under the heading code appropriate to the finished product if the constituents are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>put up in such a way that it’s clear that they’re to be used together without first being repacked<br/>presented together</li><br/>  <li>complementary to one another, either because of their nature or because of the proportions in which they’re combined</li><br/>  <li>chemicals which could be covered under more than one heading code</li><br/>  <li>some items could be classified under two or more heading codes in this chapter. If so, the heading code that comes last in numerical order is the one to use. This does not apply to subheading codes.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""ecics""><abbr title=""European Customs Inventory of Chemicals"">ECICS</abbr></h3><br/><p>It can be difficult to classify organic chemicals correctly for the purposes of the Tariff.

Thank you very much Ian.  Thanks for that introduction.  Thank you for the welcome.  It’s great to be back in Birmingham, great to be with you at PwC.</p><br/><br/><p>And, as Ian has just said, we’ve got 78 days to go before the most important political decision that most of us will make in our lifetimes: whether to stay in or to leave a reformed European Union.  And it is in many ways bigger than a general election.  If you don’t like the choice you make in a general election, you can change your mind in 5 years’ time and chuck them out.  Obviously that’s not a bit that I particularly look forward to but nonetheless it’s a very powerful part of our system.</p><br/><br/><p>But this choice about Europe, it is a choice for a generation, a choice for a lifetime: do we stay in or do we go?  Now I’m very clear that the best answer is to stay in.  I think we are better off in; I think we’re stronger in; I think we’re safer in, and I want to say a word about each of those.</p><br/><br/><p>Safer, because of course what really ensures our safety is our police, our intelligence service, our relationships around the world, but there’s no doubt in my mind, having been your Prime Minister for 6 years, that the European Union, the work we do with our partners, the information we get about criminals, about terrorists, that helps to keep us safer.</p><br/><br/><p>I believe we’re stronger in as a country because of course we’re the fifth biggest economy in the world.  We get strength through our membership of NATO, through our membership of the Commonwealth, through our relationship with the United States of America where I was last week, but we do get strength as well by being part of the European Union.  We’re there, able to make decisions, whether it’s putting sanctions on Iran, so they don’t have a nuclear weapon or whether it is having a united front against Putin and what he’s done in the Ukraine.  We are stronger because we are in the European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>I also think we have the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-best-of-both-worlds-the-united-kingdoms-special-status-in-a-reformed-european-union"">best of both worlds</a>.  Our membership of European Union is not quite like anybody else’s.  We’re in the single market but we’re out of the single currency.  We can work and travel all over Europe, but we maintain our borders and we don’t have to let people into our country if we think they are a threat to us.  So I think we have the best of both worlds and that has got better with my negotiation because I’ve made sure they cannot discriminate against the pound sterling, our currency.  I’ve made sure we have targets for burden reduction.  I’ve made sure that we’ll never be part of an ever closer political union.</p><br/><br/><p>But I think the most powerful case for staying in and the one I want to mention the most before answering your questions, is that we are better off; we are wealthier; we’re more prosperous; we’ll create more jobs; we’ll create more livelihoods for people in our country if we stay in a reformed European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>The European Union is effectively a market of 500 million people, and a market we can sell to without quotas, without tariffs, without taxes, without any impediment.  And when you think of Britain, when you think of Birmingham, when you think of the West Midlands, we are a trading nation, we need those markets open.  That is how we create jobs.  Around a quarter of a million jobs here in the West Midlands are dependent on trade with Europe.</p><br/><br/><p>Now of course that trade wouldn’t disappear altogether if we were to leave the European Union, but what would be in its place in terms of the rules?  What sort of deal would we have?  And here’s where I think your industries, and the industries you support, in the services sector need to think about this so carefully.  Because the truth is this: services make up 80% of the British economy, 4 fifths of the British economy.  And it’s absolutely vital for our services industries that we have full access to that European single market.  Now if we leave the EU, we therefore have to have some sort of deal with the EU to give us access.  Now here’s the absolutely key choice: if we went for a deal like Norway which is out of the European Union but almost a full member of the single market, you’d still have to pay into the EU, like Norway does, and accept the free movement of people from the EU, like Norway does, and yet you’d have no say over the rules that govern trade or services or standards or anything else.  Now that’s not a good deal.  And you don’t just have to take that from me; that is the view of the Norwegian Prime Minister as well.  They say to us, ‘Don’t go for the Norway option.’</p><br/><br/><p>So the alternative to that would be a free trade agreement.  Now Canada has, or is about to have, the biggest free trade agreement there is with the European Union, and some of the principal proponents of Britain leaving the EU have said we should have a Canada-style deal.  But here’s the rub: the Canada-style deal does not have really any good provisions about services.</p><br/><br/><p>Let me just give you a couple of examples.  A Canadian airline can fly between Canada and a European city, but it can’t fly within Europe.  Well what would that mean for easyJet or for Ryanair, for companies like that, that are so vital in terms of the cheap air flights that we all enjoy?  Let me give you another example.  If you’re a television station, if you’re located in Britain, you can broadcast all the way through the European Union; not if you’re a Canadian television station under the deal.  Think of financial services, and you help so many financial services companies.  With our arrangements, inside the single market, if you’re located in Britain you can trade in any European country.  If you’re Canada, your financial services companies won’t be able to do that.  They’d have to set up in each and every European country.</p><br/><br/><p>So here’s the truth; if we leave the European Union, and if we have a deal like a Canada free trade deal, it will be very bad for our economy.  It will be bad for jobs.  It will be bad for investment.  And it will be particularly bad for services industries that need those markets open.  We have a brilliant manufacturing sector in Britain; it’s important that we keep it going, not least with the huge success of Jaguar Land Rover not far away from here.  But we’re also the people that design the building, that consult on the deal, that insure the premises, that provide those vital services, those sales and other services right throughout the European Union.  And I think that above all is the reason why we should reject the idea of a free trade deal and recognise we are better off inside a European Union.  And that’s how I hope you’ll vote in 78 days’ time.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>Read more about <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternatives-to-membership-possible-models-for-the-united-kingdom-outside-the-european-union"">Alternatives to membership: possible models for the United Kingdom outside the European Union</a>.</p><br/></div><br/><br/><p>But I just want to make one final point before taking your questions, because I think a lot of these arguments can always be quite dry, quite technical.  They’re about jobs and investment, vitally important, but there’s also something else we should always think about when we consider this question of in or out.  And that is it may be 78 days until that referendum, but it is also only 70 years ago that the countries of Europe were fighting each other and killing each other’s citizens in huge numbers.</p><br/><br/><p>And yes it’s frustrating, the European Union, and I can tell you, as the person who sits round that table till often 3 or 4 in the morning, negotiating complex deals, it can be incredibly frustrating.  But the fact that we talk to each other, the fact that we work with each other, the fact that we try and collaborate and cooperate to tackle the problems and issues that we face as countries is so much better than what came before and we should never forget that, whereas our continent had been wracked by war and conflict, we have found a way now to talk to each other, to work together.  And that is something, when we think about this vote – which is not just for our generation but it’s for our children and our grandchildren – something that I hope we’ll think about.</p><br/><br/><p>Thank you again for the welcome.  I look forward to the questions.  Whatever you decide to do, please do vote in 78 days’ time.  People say there’s a lot of issues of sovereignty at stake in this referendum.  Well, this is a giant act of sovereignty.  You, the British people, are going to decide: do we stay in or do we get out?  I hope you vote to stay in, particularly after the negotiation I concluded, but it’s your choice.  I will obey the orders you give me on 23 June.  Thank you very much.</p><br/><br/><p>Right, okay.  Questions, points?  We’ve got some from the press here as well.  Let’s have the lady behind me.  Here comes a microphone; you may not need it, but just so they get you all the way up there.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Hi, Eleanor Perfect.  I’m the EU grants lead for PwC UK, so I work with PwC clients to access Horizon 2020 funding.  What’s the plan if we vote to leave, to mitigate the…?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-1"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very good point.  In case everybody doesn’t know, the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/horizon-2020"">Horizon 2020 programme</a>, that is the money particularly for universities, where Britain actually does extremely well out of science and technology and university funding.  If we look at the West Midlands as a whole, I think there’s about £700 million worth of European regional funding coming into the West Midlands between now and 2020.</p><br/><br/><p>Now of course, if we left the EU we would have to make sure we funded science in our universities, and we had the other regional funds equivalent to those things.  But you know, we can’t guarantee what it would be.  And in a way, it’s a question for the Out campaign to answer: would you replicate the very important funding that’s going into British universities or wouldn’t you?  But it is interesting that British universities, by and large, are solidly behind staying in a reformed European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>And also, there’s this point: if we left the EU, it’s pretty clear – and the Bank of England have said this – there would be a shock to our economy and we would suffer in terms of a fall in our currency, a fall in our GDP and our output, and we’d be less able to fund vital science and other projects like the Horizon programme.  So if we stay in, we know what we’re going to get, and we know that we can keep on winning for British universities, for British science; if we get out, we can’t guarantee that.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have a couple more before we go to the press.  Gentleman here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-1"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you very much.  Phil Harrold, PwC.  I lead our automotive practice in the UK, and the automotive industry is in the best health it’s been for over 40 years.  What’s the government going to do to maintain conditions for that health?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-2"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I think – look, it is a really big success story.  If I think back to my childhood, and what was going on in the motor industry then and all the difficulties we had in the 70s, you can see a situation transformed.  We are now the third largest manufacturer of automotive vehicles, of cars, in the European Union, after Germany and Spain.  We actually make more cars in the North East of our country, principally Nissan, than they do in the whole of Italy.</p><br/><br/><p>So this is a huge success story for Britain, and I would argue the success is based on great design and manufacturing skills, very good industrial relations.  But it’s also based on the fact that we are part of the European Union, and so the companies that come and invest here – whether it’s an Indian company in the case of Jaguar Land Rover, or whether it is the Japanese companies Nissan and Honda and Toyota – they come and invest here knowing they have complete access to that single market.</p><br/><br/><p>Now, if we went for a Canada‑style trade deal, we’d have to meet all sorts of rules about the origin of all the parts of our cars, and we wouldn’t necessarily get that tariff‑free access to the single market.  So if you put yourself in the mind of the Japanese car company, or Tata’s future investment in terms of Jaguar Land Rover, what would be better?  Is it better to stay in a reformed European Union, knowing you’ve got access to that market, or is it better to take a risk?  It must be better to stay in.  And I know if we vote to stay in, we’ll continue to support the car industry in the way that we have.  I think that what we’re doing, particularly on apprenticeships and skills, is a really, really strong future for that industry, and I want to see it grow.</p><br/><br/><p>And we – you know, you have to think through what would happen on 24 June and afterwards if we vote to come out.  We’re then going to spend years trying to renegotiate our relationship with Europe, and that is going to lead to huge uncertainty.  And if there’s one thing businesses hate, it is uncertainty and a lack of knowledge about what the access to the market is going to be.  So I think it’s a good example of why we should vote to stay in on 23 June.</p><br/><br/><p>Lady here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-2"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Sarah Marshall, PwC.  The ‘Midlands Engine’ has been mentioned in the last 2 consecutive Budgets without a lot of detail being out there.  If we stay in, how will you ensure that we remain top of the agenda?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-3"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very important point.  Look, I would say – I sometimes think the West Midlands thinks that it’s going to miss out because of this thing called the Northern Powerhouse, and I think that’s mistaken thinking.  I think for a long time in our country we’ve been too unbalanced in terms of too much of the economic activity has been in London and the south-east.  And the Northern Powerhouse is not about favouring the north over the West Midlands, it’s about trying to rebalance the whole country, and to create an alternative centre of strength and excellence – in manufacturing, in universities, in transport and all the rest of it – to make us a more balanced country.  And that actually is of huge benefit to the West Midlands, because West Midlands will then draw its strength not only from the fact that Birmingham is the country’s second city, but also its connectivity to London and the south, and to Manchester and Leeds and Liverpool in the north; it will draw strength from both.</p><br/><br/><p>And at the same time, we are putting a lot of investment into Birmingham.  If you think of one of the biggest investments this government’s made over the last 5 years, it’s actually the complete renewal of Birmingham New Street station; something that was absolutely vital for our country.  The biggest project coming up next is HS2, which I think has got huge benefits for Birmingham, not just in terms of journey speed and capacity, but also big regeneration of key parts of Birmingham.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think you’ll hear a lot more about the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/midlands-engine-regeneration-opportunities-pitchbook"">West Midlands Engine</a>, and I think you’ll also see this coming‑together of the local authorities in the West Midlands to try and form one West Midlands authority with one mayoral figure, who I think will be able to help drive the investment that’s needed in the West Midlands.  So I think it’s a very positive picture: if you put together transport, connectivity and the governance that’s going to change, I think it’s a very strong picture.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have Faisal Islam from Sky News.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-3"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you, Prime Minister.  The leader of the opposition has called for an investigation into your tax affairs for your own interests.  Can you clarify for the record that you and your family have not derived any benefit in the past, and will not in the future, from the offshore Blairmore Holdings fund mentioned in the Panama Papers?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-4"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Sure.  Look, what we need – the investigation we need, first of all, is for <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs"">HMRC</a>, our tax authority, to use all the information that is coming out of Panama to make sure that everything is done to make sure that companies and individuals are paying their taxes properly.  In many ways, what’s coming out of Panama is actually what we’re introducing in our own country, which is a register of beneficial ownership so everyone can see who owns what company.</p><br/><br/><p>As for my – the 2 things I’m responsible for are my own financial affairs and for the tax system of the United Kingdom.  In terms of my own financial affairs, I own no shares.  I have a salary as Prime Minister, and I have some savings which I get some interest from, and I have a house which we used to live in which we now let out while we’re living in Downing Street.  And that’s all I have; I have no shares, no offshore trusts, no offshore funds, nothing like that.  And so that, I think, is a very clear description.</p><br/><br/><p>The second thing I’m responsible for is, of course, our tax system and for international tax policy.  And I would say that no government, no prime minister has done more to make sure we crack down on tax evasion, on aggressive tax avoidance, on aggressive tax planning, both here in the UK and internationally.  So we have recovered billions of pounds in our country by changing tax regulations and rules in Budget after Budget, billions of pounds.  But we’ve also led the world in making sure we have, which we’ll have in June, an open register of <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-g20-beneficial-ownership-implementation-plan"">beneficial ownership</a> so everyone can see who owns what in Britain.</p><br/><br/><p>We haven’t just done that here in the UK, we’ve also pioneered that abroad.  We’ve said, for instance, to the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies that they have to have the automatic exchange of tax information, they have to have a single standard for reporting company taxation, and they too need to do registers of beneficial ownership.  And we’ve made huge progress on that with the Overseas Territories, with the Crown Dependencies, and other countries as well.  I started this at the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/g8-communique-and-documents"">G8 summit in Northern Ireland</a>, some years ago, and we’ve now got country after country sharing tax information, committing to beneficial ownership registers which we never had before.</p><br/><br/><p>Is there more to do?  Absolutely.  Am I committed to doing it?  Absolutely, and the anti‑corruption summit that we’re holding in London on 12 May will be yet another sort of mark along the way of making sure we deliver on this absolutely vital agenda.  We have low taxes here in Britain, but low taxes that people must pay, and that is our agenda and we’re going to stick to it.</p><br/><br/><p>Lady here?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-4"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you.  Lauren McCafferty, PwC.  Ian opened today talking about student talent and the importance of graduates to our business, and you’ve touched on some of the key arguments that would appeal to those.  I work in student recruitment myself, so I am incredibly passionate about it.  There are a lot of complex arguments coming out of both sides of the debate.  What personal message would you want to give to students who are perhaps voting for the first time in their lives to summarise the key points for them that they should consider in staying in?  Thank you.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-5"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I think to young people it is all about the opportunities of the future.  If we stay in a reformed European Union, you have the opportunity to work, to live, to travel, to study in all these different European countries, and I think that is an exciting and compelling world to live in.</p><br/><br/><p>If, on the other hand, we leave, you start your working life with probably a decade of uncertainty.  What is our relationship with the rest of Europe?  What trade deals are we going to have with other countries in the world?  What are my rights going to be if I want to go work in Spain or if I want to go travel or live in other countries?</p><br/><br/><p>So I think you’re swapping the certainty of knowing that, however this – imperfect this organisation can be, there’s lots of opportunity within it, and particularly for a country like Britain that has a special status within it.  You are swapping that for uncertainty and for something of a leap in the dark.  And I think, for people who’ve been to university, who’ve got an opportunity or people coming through school who want to do an apprenticeship, we know that what we’ve got can work for you in this organisation.  Don’t put that at risk.</p><br/><br/><p>Because this is a decision – as I say, it is not a decision you take now and then you reverse in 4 or 5 years’ time if you don’t like it, like you can with a government; this is a decision for the next generation.  So I think the younger generation need to think very carefully about what this all means.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have the Express &amp; Star.  Sir.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-5"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you.  Mr Cameron, have EU regulations harmed the British steel industry to the extent that we can’t compete with foreign import?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-6"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>No, I don’t believe they have.  Look, we’ve got a very difficult situation with the steel industry in our country, just as other countries do, because we’ve got massive global over capacity, a collapse in global prices and this makes a real challenge for our steel industry.  But we’ve got a government that’s determined to help in every way that we can.  I <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-meeting-with-welsh-first-minister-carwyn-jones-5-april-2016"">met this morning with the Welsh First Minister</a> to talk about all the things that we can do.  We’ve already helped on energy.  We’ve already helped on procurement.  We now want to make sure that Tata are looking seriously at a potential buyer for this business, and all of the business; I think it’s very important to say that.</p><br/><br/><p>And then you’d have to ask yourself the question, well would we be better off trying to do this if we were outside the European Union?  And my answer is no, we wouldn’t.  More than half of British steel goes to the European Union.  We need those markets to be open for our steel.  And if we were outside the European Union, we could be subject to those anti-dumping tariffs that the European Union is quite rightly applying to the Chinese and to other countries.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think there is a certain strength in numbers when you’re dealing with other countries in this way.  Britain is a big economy.  Fifth largest in the world.  But we are 60 million people, which, when added together with the other 440 million people in the European Union, means that we have serious power as a trading bloc, as a trading bloc in our negotiations with China or with America.</p><br/><br/><p>And I think sometimes people can think that, just because you have friendly relations with a country, you automatically get a good trade deal from it.  Now we have very friendly relations with the United States of America, no doubt about it.  But right now, how much British beef or British lamb do you think they’re buying in America?  Zero, none.  They have put some sort of block on it for, I think, very phoney reasons.  So even though you’ve got a friendly relationship, that doesn’t necessarily lead to friendly tariff and friendly trade regimes.</p><br/><br/><p>It is a tough trading world out there.  We need those European markets open.  We need strength in numbers through Europe to make sure we crack down on the dumping of Chinese and other steel, and Britain is leading the way in making sure that happens.</p><br/><br/><p>Let’s have, lady here.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-6"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Hello.  How diverse do you think the UK government is?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-7"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Very good question.  We were talking about this a bit earlier.  Not as diverse as it should be, but I think we have made some important steps forward.  We’ve now got – sitting around the cabinet table, one third of the people round the cabinet table are women, which is a big change from when I first came into politics.  When I became leader of the Conservative party, I think we had 17 or 18 women MPs; we’ve now got over 70.  So that’s a big change, but as we’ve got 300 – more than 300 MPs, it’s not enough.</p><br/><br/><p>In terms of diversity in terms of the ethnic diversity of Parliament, that’s changed a lot in recent years and I think that is really positive.  And if I look around my cabinet table, we were just talking about the steel industry, and my Business Secretary, his dad came from Pakistan to drive the busses in London, and in one generation his son is sitting around the cabinet table responsible for one of the most important portfolios in government.</p><br/><br/><p>So I think we are becoming more diverse.  I think we do need not positive discrimination but positive action, you need to make sure that people can make it right to the top and you need to demonstrate that, because I think role models are so important in this, and I’m sure you find this in PwC.  It’s all very well saying we’re an equal opportunities employer, we’re all based on merit, you can go as high as your talent allows.  That’s great, but if you open the door and all you see is a sea of white male faces, it’s not very encouraging.</p><br/><br/><p>So I have always believed, if you want to have a more diverse workforce, have a more diverse leadership, change your country in that way, you need to take some quite strong positive action to make sure that we access all of the talent of the country.  And that is the key point in the end.</p><br/><br/><p>This is not about political correctness; this is about effectiveness.  PwC would not be half as effective as it is if it locked out women and people from Britain’s ethnic minorities into its teams.  My wife would say it would be considerably less than 50% efficient if that was the case.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-7"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Say, for example, if we do end up having to leave the EU, people vote that they don’t want to stay, for European companies who’ve invested in the – invested in the UK, what impact would it have on them, and what incentive would they have to stay?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-8"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well, very good question.  What – in case everyone didn’t hear, for the foreign companies that invested in the UK, if we were to leave the EU, what effect would it have on them?  The short answer is that you can’t say for certain until you know what the alternative arrangements are that Britain would put in place.  And so it’s really a question the Leave campaign have got to answer.</p><br/><br/><p>But the truth is this: if we opted for a situation like Norway, which is basically almost a member of the single market, the situation wouldn’t change very much because those companies would still have access to European markets, but Norway pays into the EU about the same per head of population as we do.  So the people who say I want to get out of Europe because I want to stop contributing to the budget, well the Norway solution doesn’t help.  Ditto when it comes to the free movement of people.  Norway has to sign up to the free movement of people, so anyone from another EU country can go and live and work in Norway.  In fact, they won’t even have my welfare deal where, under my new arrangements, you don’t get full access to our welfare system if you come from another European country for 4 years.</p><br/><br/><p>So that’s the Norway answer, which would be reassuring, I think, to foreign investors and other European investors who’ve come to build plants and businesses in Britain.  But that’s not what the Leave campaigners say they want, because they don’t want to pay in to the EU, and they don’t want free movement of people.</p><br/><br/><p>So therefore you have to look at a free trade deal.  And the longer you look at these free trade deals, the more you can see, they take a very long time to come in.  The Canada one has been 7 years in negotiation and still hasn’t been passed.  So you’ve got 7 years of uncertainty; 7 years of the Japanese car company thinking, ‘Shall I put more investment in Britain or not?’; 7 years of, you know, the Indian company thinking, ‘Should I invest more in this great automotive business or should I put that money somewhere else?’</p><br/><br/><p>And then if you do go for a Canada-style free trade deal, you may well find that you don’t have the access to the market that you used to have.  So I was looking at this Canada free trade deal, and this is relevant, I think, to your business.  They don’t have automatic access to all European markets for their accountancy businesses.  Indeed, in France you have to have the permission, I think, of the Finance Ministry in order to set up a bookkeeping business in France.</p><br/><br/><p>And you lay yourself open as a country, and as a group of companies, and as an economy, to putting yourself into a very difficult situation, where of course the French accountancy firms will be saying, ‘Well don’t let the Brits in.  Let’s favour our own accountancy firms.’  You know, you’d get car manufacturers in Spain lobbying their government, saying, ‘Well don’t give them a good free trade deal.  Let’s have more cars made in Spain.’</p><br/><br/><p>These are all things that cannot happen now because we have this unimpeded access to this market of 500 million people.  And that is why I think for us to vote to leave the European Union would be an act of economic and political self-harm to our country, which is why I am going to campaign very hard in the next 78 days to say that we really should not take this step.</p><br/><br/><p>And I’ll say again what I’ve said before.  I’m not standing to be your Prime Minister again at the next election.  I’ve got no other agenda here than saying what I think after 6 years of being your Prime Minister is the best thing for our country, for our economy, for our businesses, for our families.  And I have no hesitation in saying, yes, there are frustrations with this organisation, but we are better off, we are stronger, we are safer if we stay inside it.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>Prime Minster.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-9"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Let’s just take a couple more and then we’ll have one more from the press.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-8"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>I think you’ve touched a – thank you.  I think you touched a little bit on diversity and [inaudible] as well.  I know this is about EU, but Theresa May has been making it really hard for people from non-EU backgrounds to be working here.  What is your stance on that?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-10"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>Well I agree with Theresa May.  I mean, that’s – we’re in the cabinet together, so we’d have to agree with each other.  But look, the point is this –</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker-1"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>You haven’t always though.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-11"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>I know.  The point is this, we have had very big pressure in terms of migration into the UK.  It’s been running at, you know, well over 100,000 a year, sometimes 200,000 a year or more going back for around a decade now.  And people want us and I want us to control immigration.  Immigration is good for the country.  It is good that people come and work here and make their home here and contribute, but you do need to try and have a control over the numbers and a control over the pressures.</p><br/><br/><p>And so what we’ve done is say, well we’re going to attack this – deal with this problem in 2 ways.  First of all, for people coming from outside the EU, we put a cap on economic migration of some 20,000 a year, and we put in place some restrictions so that students can come, but they must be genuine students to genuine universities.  We’ve closed down dozens of bogus colleges.</p><br/><br/><p>So that’s how we’ve approached the issue of migration from outside the EU but I know it does sometimes cause frustrations inside the EU where there is the right to go and live and work in other European countries, just as we have the right to go and work in their countries.  So the approach we’ve taken there is on welfare, which is we have a very generous in-work welfare system.  People can earn as much as, you know, £8,000, £9,000, £10,000 of tax credits when they come to our country.  So that’s why we’ve negotiated this unique ability for the next 7 years to be able to say you don’t get full access to our welfare system until you’ve been here for 4 years.  And I think that’s a very positive way of saying, yes we want people to come but we want people to pay in before they get out.  No something for nothing.</p><br/><br/><p>So this does create difficulties and problems, and I know there can be pressures for more people who want to come, but I think both inside the EU and outside the EU, we need to have that controlled immigration, which is what we’re delivering.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""question-9"">Question</h2><br/><br/><p>Prime Minister, as you can see we’re a people business, so how would an in vote benefit the employment market as we run up to 2020?</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""prime-minister-12"">Prime Minister</h2><br/><br/><p>The employment market?  Well I mean, first of all the good news is over the last 6 years we’ve seen something like 2.3 million more people in work, so we are a job factory.  We’ve been creating a lot of jobs in our country, and this has put on some of the immigration pressure.  And I would say the best thing we can do is keep going with the economic plan that we’ve got.  It’s a plan that’s working and one of the things that could upset the plan is creating uncertainty.  And one of the ways we create jobs is having access to Europe’s markets, making sure we complete these trade deals with North America, with India, with China, and that I think is the best way to secure jobs and secure growth.</p><br/><br/><p>Whereas the uncertainty of maybe 7, maybe 10 years of not knowing exactly what your relationship is with Europe, what your trade deals are with the rest of the world, companies wondering about whether they’re going to come in and invest here, companies that are already here thinking about should we grow more in Britain or should we go somewhere else, that is uncertainty that we do not need.</p><br/><br/><p>And that is why, as I said, I think there are so many good arguments for staying in a reformed EU: the argument about safety and fighting terrorism, the argument about Britain’s strength in the world and being able to get things done.  But I do think the strongest single argument is this issue of our economy, of jobs, of people’s prosperity, because, in the end, that is what I think people want to know.  What is my best chance of securing a good future for myself and for my family, having a job, being able to contribute and deliver in that way?  That’s the most important thing, and that’s the question I think people should have in their minds as they go into the polling booth.</p><br/><br/><p>Can I say you’ve been a really brilliant audience?  Thank you very much for the welcome, thank you for all you do at PwC.  I can see you have achieved a very diverse and very strong workforce, and it’s been great to come here to Birmingham and join you today.</p><br/><br/><p>Thank you very much indeed.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""speaker-2"">Speaker</h2><br/><br/><p>Thank you, Prime Minister.</p><br/><br/><div class=""call-to-action""><br/><p>Find out more on <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-best-of-both-worlds-the-united-kingdoms-special-status-in-a-reformed-european-union"">the UK’s special status in a reformed EU</a> and <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternatives-to-membership-possible-models-for-the-united-kingdom-outside-the-european-union"">alternatives to EU membership</a>.</p><br/></div><br/><br/></div></p>",

On the visit to Beefeater today (12th May), Exchequer Secretary Damian Hinds was told by spirit industry leaders that this number may fall if the UK leaves the European Union.</p><br/><br/><p>Industry leaders who met the Exchequer Secretary warned that losing access to the EU single market, which makes overseas trade far easier for highly regulated industries such as alcohol, could mean that UK producers won’t be able to trade as freely due to the loss of EU common standards.</p><br/><br/><p>A recent survey carried out by the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) found that the UK wine and spirit trade will be stronger if Britain remained in the European Union. As part of a consultation of its 300 plus members this message was endorsed by 90% of those who responded.</p><br/><br/><p>Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, Damian Hinds said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The UK’s gin industry is undergoing a remarkable renaissance with the rest of the world developing a taste for our world-leading gin. The message from industry voices and famous gin makers like Beefeater is clear; leaving the EU would hit exports hard and could apply the brakes to the gin boom. I believe that gin like the rest of our spirits industry will be stronger, safer and better off within a reformed EU.</p><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><br/>  <p>The great tradition of British gin making is supported by remaining in Europe - for both exporting and quality reasons. Exports of gin have risen by 46% in the past five years, with sales to 139 countries, worth £2.18 billion over that period. In 2015 alone the UK exported £231 million worth of gin to non EU countries and an impressive £189 million to consumers inside the EU’s single market.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">Without the benefit of the quality standards underpinned by the European definition of gin our producers and their brands could find themselves with fewer consumers, fewer trading partners and a less glowing global reputation.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>Laurent Lacassagne, Chairman &amp; CEO of Chivas Brothers, owner of Beefeater gin said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p>While this is clearly a decision that will be and should be made by the UK public, Chivas Brothers believes that being part of the EU supports the continued success and future of spirits made in and exported from the UK like gin and Scotch whisky.</p><br/><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">The EU’s single market, such as its regulation of food and drink, combined with its single trade policy, are vital to our industry and our brands. The result is fair access to markets, which in turn supports jobs, growth and the industry in the long-term.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>During his visit Mr Hinds toured the distillery and saw how the historic Beefeater gin is made. <br/>According to the WSTA a total of 1.6 billion gin and tonics were sold globally in 2014 and almost 140 million bottles of gin made in the UK are now exported every year.</p><br/><br/><p>Government statistics also show that between 2010 and 2015 a total of 174 new spirit distilleries opened in the UK - with 56 new licences issued in the past year alone. The number of UK gin brands has more than doubled since 2010 from 31 to 73 due to the demand for new brands.</p><br/><br/><p>Following the Chancellor’s 2% cut to spirits duty last year, duty on spirits was frozen at Budget 2016. Duty on a bottle of gin remains £7.26. The tax is 81p lower since ending the spirits duty escalator in 2014.</p><br/></div></p>",

There are however, exceptions to this.</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><h2 id=""what-is-meant-by-disrepair"">What is meant by disrepair</h2><br/><br/><p>A property might be in disrepair because:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>it has fallen into disrepair over time</li><br/>  <li>it has been damaged</li><br/>  <li>it has been vandalised</li><br/>  <li>there has been a fire or a flood</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""rateable-value-and-disrepair"">Rateable value and disrepair</h2><br/><br/><p>Legislation provides a definition of rateable value that applies to all properties. Rateable value represents the rental value of a property if it was let at the standard valuation date on the basis that the tenant pays for all repairs during the letting. The definition includes an assumption that the property is let in a state of reasonable repair.</p><br/><br/><p>As a general rule disrepair does not affect a property’s rateable value, however there are exceptions:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the property is in such a state of disrepair that a reasonable landlord would consider the repair costs to be uneconomic</li><br/>  <li>the property is in such a state of disrepair that a reasonable landlord might repair only part of it</li><br/>  <li>the property has been so badly damaged by fire or flooding that it can’t be economically repaired and used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If a reasonable landlord would consider it uneconomic to do the repairs, then the rental valuation will be based on the basis of the actual state of repair.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""what-is-meant-by-repair"">What is meant by repair</h2><br/><br/><p>Repair only covers fixing any parts of the property that are in disrepair. It should be repaired to a standard that is expected for a property of its age, character, locality and the type of tenant likely to occupy it.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, the expected standard of repair for a modern office building would be much higher than that for an old warehouse.</p><br/><br/><p>Repair can include an element of renewal but not improvement. This means, for example, that a leaking flat roof would usually be patch repaired to make it watertight and not fully replaced with a slated pitch roof.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""uneconomic-to-repair"">Uneconomic to repair</h2><br/><br/><p>A property is considered uneconomic to repair if the repair costs are so out of proportion to the rental value that a reasonable landlord would not spend the money doing them. This is because it would be unlikely they would get an adequate return on the investment and it would not be financially worthwhile.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""properties-being-repaired"">Properties being repaired</h2><br/><br/><p>If work is being undertaken to repair a property, this is considered in just the same way as a property needing repair. If the works would be considered economically reasonable then the property is treated as already being in reasonable repair for rating.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""alterations-being-carried-out-to-a-property"">Alterations being carried out to a property</h2><br/><br/><p>It may be that the rateable value of a property can be reduced whilst the work is underway, depending on the extent of the work being carried out to improve, extend or enhance it. Each case will be considered on its own facts.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""if-you-believe-your-property-is-in-uneconomic-repair"">If you believe your property is in ‘uneconomic repair’</h2><br/><br/><p>If you don’t feel that it’s cost effective to repair your property, you should tell the VOA using their <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates"">online service</a> as soon as possible. You need to provide all the evidence that your property is in a state of substantial disrepair, so that the valuation officer can investigate.</p><br/><br/><p>Useful evidence includes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>photographs of the repairs required and the extent of those repairs</li><br/>  <li>an itemised estimate of repair costs and work required</li><br/>  <li>the history of occupation and use of the premises</li><br/>  <li>future plans or proposals for the occupation and use of the building, including any planning applications or permissions</li><br/>  <li>where the property is being altered, a schedule of the work being undertaken which details each stage and the point in time when that stage began</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The VOA will consider the evidence you provide and decide whether or not the repairs required have an impact on rateable value.</p><br/><br/><p>If the VOA thinks that the repairs needed have a negative effect on the rateable value of your property, they may reduce the rateable value figure or even give a nil value, depending on the extent of the repair.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""inspection-of-your-property"">Inspection of your property</h2><br/><br/><p>A valuation officer may need to inspect your property and you should let the VOA know of any health and safety arrangements, if applicable.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""if-you-disagree-with-the-voas-decision"">If you disagree with the VOA’s decision</h2><br/><br/><p>If you disagree with the valuation officer’s decision, you can make a challenge through the VOA’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates"">online service</a> if your property is in England. For properties in Wales, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-rates-proposal-to-alter-the-2017-rating-list"">complete a proposal form</a> and send it to the VOA.</p><br/><br/><p>If you decide to make a challenge, you should provide as much evidence as possible of why you think your rateable value is wrong.</p><br/><br/><p>The VOA will discuss the case with you and if you can’t reach an agreement, you can contact the  <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.valuationtribunal.gov.uk/rating.aspx"">Valuation Tribunal</a> to make an appeal.</p><br/></div></p>",

There are six <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rules"">GIRs</abbr>, which are set out in Section I of the second volume of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 1 directs that:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">For legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.</p><br/></blockquote><br/><br/><p>A heading code is a four digit code, while a chapter code is a two digit code, (the first two of the heading code). The terms of the heading descriptions - and the notes to each section and chapter - are paramount when it comes to classifying goods correctly.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 6 determines how goods are classified at the level of a subheading code - a code with six or more digits. So if an item is classified using a code of six or more digits both <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 6 and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 1 will always apply.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3 and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 4 sometimes also apply depending on the nature of the goods to be classified. It’s important to note that you must consider each <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> in sequence. For example, you cannot use <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c to classify goods until you have tried using <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2a, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 2b, <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3a and <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3b.</p><br/><br/><p><abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 5 applies to certain types of container and to packing materials presented with the items they’re designed to package. </p><br/><br/><p>Guidance notes on interpreting each <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> are included in the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Notes"">HSENs</abbr>) to the Tariff.

To correctly classify composite goods like this, try to establish which device performs the main function. Then you can classify the whole item under the heading code for the device that performs this main function.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s not possible to establish which device in a composite item performs the main function, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c. According to this rule, of all the possible heading or subheading codes that could equally apply, the code that comes last in numerical order is used to classify the goods.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying composite goods.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""multifunctional-goods"">Multifunctional goods</h3><br/><br/><p>Multifunctional goods are items that are designed to perform two or more complementary or alternative functions. For example, a clock radio tells the time and receives radio signals.</p><br/><br/><p>To classify a multifunctional item correctly, try to establish its main function. If this is possible, classify the item under the heading or subheading code appropriate to that function as if that were the item’s only function.</p><br/><br/><p>If it’s not possible to establish which the main function is, then the goods are classified according to <abbr title=""General Interpretative Rule"">GIR</abbr> 3c as outlined above.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 3 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying multifunctional goods.</p><br/><br/><p>Individual components that work together to perform a single function some items consist of a series of individual components that are intended to contribute together to a clearly defined function covered by one of the heading codes in chapter 85. The components can be separate or connected by any means like cables or wireless devices.</p><br/><br/><p>If an item matches this description, then the whole item is classified under the heading code that’s appropriate to the function it performs.</p><br/><br/><p>Note 4 to Section XVI sets out the legal basis for classifying single function goods made up of several components.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""some-useful-definitions"">Some useful definitions</h2><br/><br/><p>Definitions of some of the terms used in this guide - and in chapter 85 of the Tariff - are listed below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>external power source - a power source like mains electricity that does not come from within an item’s own casing - a vehicle’s battery is an external power source</li><br/>  <li>image size ratio - or ‘aspect ratio’ -  the ratio of a television or monitor screen’s image width to its image height</li><br/>  <li>independently powered - see ‘portable’ below</li><br/>  <li>non-film cameras - these are devices like digital cameras that do not use photographic film or plates to record images</li><br/>  <li>play, player - in this guide, a sound or video player is a device that reproduces recorded or saved sound or video</li><br/>  <li>portable - in this guide, a ‘portable’ electrical appliance is one that can operate without an external power source - it might, for example, be powered by internal batteries, a built-in clockwork generator or an integral solar panel. It might be able to work with an external power source too</li><br/>  <li>radio, radio tuner and radio receiver - these terms are used interchangeably in this guide and refer to a device that can receive radio broadcasts and signals - note though that a radio tuner might not have a built-in amplifier</li><br/>  <li>video recorder, cassette recorder - common names for devices that can often both record and play back sound or video</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/><br/></div></p>",

</p><h4>Body</h4><p><div class=""govspeak""><p>The second annual <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-nation-2014-report"">State of the Nation Report</a> which is published and laid before Parliament today from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission (SMCP), shows that Britain is on the brink of becoming a permanently divided nation.</p><br/><br/><p>The Report says that while a strong economic recovery and a record number of people in work are welcome, the social recovery needed to get Britain back on track to abolish child poverty has not happened. Instead it predicts 2020 is set to mark the end of the first decade since records began without a fall in absolute poverty.</p><br/><br/><p>The Report warns that “2020 could mark a watershed between an era in which for decades there have been rising living standards shared by all and a future era where rising living standards by-pass the poorest in society.”</p><br/><br/><p>It warns that the link between effort and reward on which social mobility relies has been broken by changes in the housing market - with home ownership rates halving among young people in 20 years - and the labour market - with 5 million workers trapped in low pay.</p><br/><br/><p>When combined with cuts in welfare and public spending, these changes put Britain on track to become a permanently divided nation unless radical new approaches are taken by the next government to meet this 2020 challenge. It finds no political party is being honest about the impact of planned spending cuts or has sufficiently ambitious plans to tackle entrenched levels of low pay.</p><br/><br/><p>It comes to the reluctant conclusion that there is no way the government can meet the statutory target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. It calls on the next government to supplement the existing targets with new measures to give a more rounded picture of poverty and to publish a new timescale for achieving them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""the-report-advises-the-government-to-commit-to-the-following-objectives"">The report advises the government to commit to the following objectives:</h3><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-macro-economic-policy-to-recouple-economic-growth-with-earnings-growth"">For macro-economic policy, to recouple economic growth with earnings growth.</h4><br/>    <p>Closing the chasm between low income households and the rest can no longer rely on tax credits to do all the heavy lifting – employers will have to raise wages and workers will have to increase their hours. The key recommendation is that the UK should commit to becoming a Living Wage nation by 2025 at the latest.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-fiscal-policy-to-ensure-future-fiscal-consolidation-minimizes-the-impact-on-child-poverty-and-social-mobility"">For fiscal policy, to ensure future fiscal consolidation minimizes the impact on child poverty and social mobility.</h4><br/>    <p>Tough choices will have to be made but the working poor will need to be better protected.  The recommendation is that the Office of Budget Responsibility should publish an assessment of each Budget for its impact on social mobility and child poverty.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-social-policy-to-ensure-that-young-people-are-not-left-behind-as-the-labour-market-moves-ahead"">For social policy, to ensure that young people are not left behind as the labour market moves ahead.</h4><br/>    <p>Young people are losing out on jobs, wages and housing so the next government should commit to end long-term youth unemployment by 2020. The key recommendation is that half of all larger workplaces should offer quality apprenticeships.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-housing-policy-to-ensure-it-contributes-to-more-social-mobility-and-less-child-poverty"">For housing policy, to ensure it contributes to more social mobility and less child poverty.</h4><br/>    <p>This generation of young people is far less likely to progress onto the housing ladder than their parents’ generation.  The key recommendation is to create new forms of housing tenure through expanded shared ownership schemes and reform of the private rented sector.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-education-policy-to-ensure-it-closes-the-attainment-gap-between-disadvantaged-children-and-their-better-off-peers"">For education policy, to ensure it closes the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their better off peers.</h4><br/>    <p>Without a new focus the gap in attainment between the poorest children and their better-off peers will take 20 years to even halve.  The key recommendation is that the best teachers should be paid more to teach in the worst schools to help end illiteracy and innumeracy in primary school by 2025 and to halve the attainment gap in secondary school by 2020.</p><br/>  </li><br/>  <li><br/>    <h4 id=""for-universities-and-employers-to-ensure-they-recruit-from-a-broader-range-of-talent-universities-and-professions-are-poised-to-expand-dramatically-and-this-needs-to-bring-with-it-a-social-mobility-dividend"">For universities and employers, to ensure they recruit from a broader range of talent.

Some of the terms and phrases commonly used to describe stone and stone articles are listed below.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bossed-stone"">Bossed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>Bossed stone is stone that’s been given a ‘rock-faced’ finish. It’s smoothed along its edges but has rough, uneven faces.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bushed-stone"">Bushed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>Bushed stone has a surface that’s been dressed - or smoothed - using a special hammer. A bushing hammer has several rows of pyramid-shaped studs or spikes on its striking face (or faces).</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""calcareous-rock"">Calcareous rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Calcareous rock is sedimentary rock that contains a considerable amount of calcium carbonate. Examples include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>limestone</li><br/>  <li>dolomite</li><br/>  <li>chalk</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""carding"">Carding</h3><br/><br/><p>Carding is a process used to untangle and clean fibres. It produces a continuous web or sliver of the fibre. Mineral fibres, for example, may be carded.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""corbel"">Corbel</h3><br/><br/><p>A corbel is a stone, brick or block that sticks out from a wall to support a weight above it.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""dressed-stone"">Dressed stone</h3><br/><br/><p>A stone that’s been dressed has had one or more of its surfaces smoothed.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""exfoliation"">Exfoliation</h3><br/><br/><p>Exfoliation is the removal of loose flakes, layers or scales from a piece of stone.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""flagstone"">Flagstone</h3><br/><br/><p>A flagstone is a flat, relatively thin slab of stone that’s used for paving or for covering a hole. Natural flagstones are cut from sedimentary rock that splits easily into layers. They’re often made of fine-grained sandstones.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""flocculent"">Flocculent</h3><br/><br/><p>A flocculent material is one that’s made up of cloud-like or fluffy tufts (flocs). Mineral wool could be described as flocculent, for example.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""igneous-rock"">Igneous rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Igneous rock is rock that was formed as the earth’s magma cooled and solidified. Examples include basalt and granite. It is one of the three main types of rock. The other two are sedimentary and metamorphic.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""kerbstone"">Kerbstone</h3><br/><br/><p>Kerbstones are stones that are placed edgeways along the side of a path, road or pavement.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""metamorphic-rock"">Metamorphic rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Metamorphic rock starts life as an existing rock that’s altered by environmental processes such as heat or pressure. Just about any rock can become metamorphic rock. Examples include slate and marble.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""porphyry"">Porphyry</h3><br/><br/><p>Porphyry is a general term for igneous rocks that have quite large individual crystals - usually feldspar or quartz - set in fine-grained material (‘groundmass’). An example would be granite-porphyry.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sedimentary-rock"">Sedimentary rock</h3><br/><br/><p>Sedimentary rock is formed by the accumulation of particles such as sand and shell fragments. Examples include limestone and sandstone.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sett"">Sett</h3><br/><br/><p>A sett is a small rectangular stone block, often granite. These were once used to surface roads and are now more commonly used for domestic pathways and driveways. Typical dimensions are 15 centimetres to 23 centimetres long, 7 centimetres to 10 centimetres wide and 15 centimetres deep.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""soapstone-steatite"">Soapstone (steatite)</h3><br/><br/><p>Soapstone - or steatite - is a coarse type of talc. It comes in blocks or chunks and often looks like marble. It is a soft stone that’s easy to carve, so it’s often used to make ornaments and jewellery. It can also be fired to produce a very hard material that’s often used to make electrical insulators.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""stucco"">Stucco</h3><br/><br/><p>Stucco is a smooth surfaced plaster or cement render that’s applied to external walls.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""touchstone"">Touchstone</h3><br/><br/><p>Touchstone is also known as lydian stone or lydite. It is a highly siliceous material, meaning it contains a lot of silica. It is normally black and evenly fine grained and does not splinter.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""identifying-fired-ceramics"">Identifying fired ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>Fired ceramic articles can be made of various different materials. To classify a fired ceramic item correctly, it’s important to identify the material that it’s made of.</p><br/><br/><p>Examples of different fired ceramic materials such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>common pottery</li><br/>  <li>earthenware</li><br/>  <li>stoneware</li><br/>  <li>fine pottery</li><br/>  <li>porcelain (or china)</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""common-pottery"">Common pottery</h3><br/><br/><p>Common pottery is porous and has large, clearly visible impurities in it. These impurities could include, for example, sand and other aggregates or even straw. Common pottery articles usually have a natural colour such as yellow, red, grey or beige - they’re rarely white.</p><br/><br/><p>It’s easy to scratch or score common pottery articles because they’re quite soft compared with other types of ceramic. Bowl-shaped articles give a dull sound when they’re tapped.</p><br/><br/><p>Common pottery is typically used to make things such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>garden pots</li><br/>  <li>drainage pipes</li><br/>  <li>bricks</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""earthenware"">Earthenware</h3><br/><br/><p>Earthenware items are usually glazed. Earthenware is porous and has impurities, but they’re small and invisible to the naked eye. Unglazed areas are easy to scratch - they give off a powder (‘dandruff’) when they’re scored.</p><br/><br/><p>Earthenware articles usually have a natural colour like grey, red, brown, yellow, cream or off-white. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped. Bowl-shaped articles give a dull sound when they’re tapped.</p><br/><br/><p>Earthenware is often used to make things such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tableware and kitchenware</li><br/>  <li>household articles</li><br/>  <li>sanitary articles</li><br/>  <li>tiles and paving</li><br/>  <li>ornaments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for earthenware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Terracotta</li><br/>  <li>Creamware</li><br/>  <li>Cistercian</li><br/>  <li>Dolomite (not resin bound)</li><br/>  <li>Faience</li><br/>  <li>Majolica</li><br/>  <li>Moilica</li><br/>  <li>Mochaware</li><br/>  <li>Slipware</li><br/>  <li>Delftware</li><br/>  <li>Gallyware</li><br/>  <li>Galleryware</li><br/>  <li>Queensware</li><br/>  <li>Agateware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""terracotta"">Terracotta</h3><br/><br/><p>Identifying terracotta - ‘baked earth’ in Italian - can be confusing. It is a common mistake to think that any red or red-brown pottery must be terracotta, but it may not be. Most clays, including stoneware and porcelain, can be dyed or pigmented to give a terracotta colour, but they will not have the other characteristics of true terracotta.</p><br/><br/><p>True terracotta - including branded Terracotta - can usually be identified as earthenware and has the same characteristics. A laboratory test may be needed to be absolutely sure, but it can usually be identified correctly by looking closely at it, scratching it and tapping it.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""fine-pottery"">Fine pottery</h3><br/><br/><p>Fine pottery is similar to earthenware, but the colour ranges from yellow to brown - or reddish brown.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""stoneware"">Stoneware</h3><br/><br/><p>Stoneware is not porous (except under laboratory testing). Often it is not glazed, although articles like kitchenware and tableware usually do have a glaze. It is difficult to scratch and common colours include off-white, grey or blue-grey, and beige. Sometimes the clay’s dyed before it’s shaped.</p><br/><br/><p>Bowl-shaped stoneware articles give a clear sound when they’re tapped. Stoneware is commonly used to make the same sorts of things as earthenware.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for stoneware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Basalt Ware</li><br/>  <li>Cane Ware</li><br/>  <li>Crouch Ware</li><br/>  <li>Etrusian Ware</li><br/>  <li>Jasper Ware</li><br/>  <li>Oven Ware</li><br/>  <li>Salt-glazed Ware</li><br/>  <li>Yellow Ware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""dolomite"">Dolomite</h3><br/><br/><p>Dolomite is a natural mineral. It is often calcined - fired - and mixed with materials such as steatite to make things like firebricks for kilns. Sometimes it’s mixed with clay and fired to make household articles. These are similar to earthenware.</p><br/><br/><p>Dolomite and other stone can also be crushed and mixed with resins before being made into articles like house-wares and ornaments. Household items made of dolomite are almost always mixed with a material like clay or resin.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""porcelain-or-china"">Porcelain or china</h3><br/><br/><p>Porcelain - or china - includes bone china. It is non-porous and usually difficult to scratch.</p><br/><br/><p>Porcelain articles are usually white and shiny. Sometimes the clay is dyed before it’s shaped. Porcelain is normally translucent when it’s held up to a light.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical trade names for porcelain articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>Bone China</li><br/>  <li>Jet Enamelled Ware</li><br/>  <li>Parian Ware</li><br/>  <li>Pythagoras Ware</li><br/>  <li>Rockingham Ware</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""porcelain-look-alikes"">Porcelain look-alikes</h3><br/><br/><p>Sometimes, pottery is made up to look like porcelain. ‘Imitation porcelain’ and ‘semi-porcelain’ items are glazed and decorated to resemble porcelain, but they’re quite different in other ways. For example, beneath their shiny white glaze they’re rough grained, dull and porous, and can easily be scratched with a steel knife (although some soft china can also be scratched like this). Articles like this are not classified as porcelain or china.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-functional-household-ceramics"">Classifying functional household ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>A ‘functional’ item is one that’s designed to serve a useful purpose. Functional household items are often decorated too, but the decoration does not affect their usefulness - they work just as well as similar but plain examples.</p><br/><br/><p>Some examples of functional household ceramic items include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tableware such plates, bowls and dishes</li><br/>  <li>kitchenware such as pots, pans and jugs</li><br/>  <li>toilet articles such as soap dishes</li><br/>  <li>other household items such as ashtrays</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Household ceramic articles that have a clear functional purpose are classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what they’re made of.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tableware"">Tableware</h3><br/><br/><p>Some examples of ceramic tableware articles include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>tea and coffee services and pots</li><br/>  <li>plates, dishes and trays</li><br/>  <li>tureens and bowls</li><br/>  <li>mugs and cups</li><br/>  <li>spoons</li><br/>  <li>cruets, salt cellars and sauce boats</li><br/>  <li>egg cups and teapot stands</li><br/>  <li>table mats, knife rests and serviette rings</li><br/>  <li>tiles specially designed or adapted to be used as table mats</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Functional ceramic tableware items are classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china.

If they’re made of other fired ceramics then they’re classified under heading code 6912.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""toilet-articles"">Toilet articles</h3><br/><br/><p>Examples of ceramic toilet articles - which may be intended for either domestic or non-domestic use - include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>toilet sets - ewers, bowls and similar items</li><br/>  <li>sanitary pails</li><br/>  <li>bed pans and chamber pots</li><br/>  <li>spittoons, douche cans and eye baths</li><br/>  <li>soap dishes, towel rails, toilet paper holders and toothbrush holders</li><br/>  <li>towel hooks</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Functional ceramic toilet articles also include other similar items for bathrooms, toilets and kitchens, including things designed to be fixed to a wall. They’re classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china and under heading code 6912 if they’re made of other fired ceramics.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-household-articles"">Other household articles</h3><br/><br/><p>Other functional ceramic household articles include ashtrays, matchbox holders and so on. Once again, they’re classified under heading code 6911 if they’re made of porcelain or china and under heading code 6912 if they’re made of other fired ceramics.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-ornamental-ceramics"">Classifying ornamental ceramics</h2><br/><br/><p>A ceramic article is classified as ‘ornamental’ if its usefulness is clearly less important than its decorative characteristics. For example, plates that are moulded in relief or teapots that have hollow handles are considered to be ornamental products.</p><br/><br/><p>Ornamental ceramic products are classified under heading code 6913. This heading code covers a wide range of ceramic articles used for decorating the interiors of homes, offices, churches and other buildings. It also covers outdoor products like garden ornaments.</p><br/><br/><p>Ornamental articles can also be made of unfired materials such as crushed stone mixed with resin. These are classified under heading code 3926 when the resin gives the articles their essential character.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""statues-and-other-ornaments"">Statues and other ornaments</h3><br/><br/><p>Products such as these are purely ornamental and have no practical use. They include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>statues, statuettes, busts, haut or bas reliefs, and other figures for interior or exterior decoration</li><br/>  <li>ornaments such as animals and symbolic or mythical figures designed to be put on mantelpieces and shelves. These also include ornaments that form parts of clock sets</li><br/>  <li>sporting or art trophies</li><br/>  <li>wall ornaments such as tiles, plates, trays and plaques that have fittings for hanging</li><br/>  <li>medallions</li><br/>  <li>fire screens</li><br/>  <li>artificial flowers, fruit, leaves and so on that are made in one piece</li><br/>  <li>wreaths and similar ornaments for tombs</li><br/>  <li>knick-knacks for shelves or domestic display cabinets</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""religious-ornaments"">Religious ornaments</h3><br/><br/><p>These include ceramic ornaments such as crucifixes and other church and religious ornaments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bowls-vases-and-pots"">Bowls, vases and pots</h3><br/><br/><p>These include products such as table bowls, vases, pots and jardinières that are purely ornamental.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""tableware-and-domestic-articles"">Tableware and domestic articles</h3><br/><br/><p>These products are only classified under heading code 6913 if their usefulness is clearly less important than their decorative characteristics. Examples include products such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>trays moulded in relief, which makes them nearly useless</li><br/>  <li>ornaments incorporating an incidental tray or container that can be used as a trinket dish or ashtray</li><br/>  <li>miniatures that do not have any genuine usefulness</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>However, tableware and domestic utensils are generally designed to be useful. In most cases, any decoration is secondary and does not restrict their usefulness. So if a decorated ceramic household product can be used just as effectively as a plain item, it’s considered to be functional and not ornamental. Functional items are classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what they’re made of.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-ornamental-items"">Other ornamental items</h3><br/><br/><p>These include ceramic articles - other than tableware and domestic utensils - that are used for interior decoration, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>smokers’ sets</li><br/>  <li>jewel cases, cachou boxes and cigarette boxes</li><br/>  <li>perfume burners</li><br/>  <li>ink stands</li><br/>  <li>book-ends</li><br/>  <li>paperweights and similar desktop items</li><br/>  <li>picture frames</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Ceramic cornices, friezes and similar architectural ornaments are not classified under heading code 6913, even though they may have ornamental characteristics. They’re classified under heading code 6905 instead.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-tiles-and-building-products"">Classifying tiles and building products</h2><br/><br/><p>Tiles and building products are covered in Chapter 68 and Chapter 69. Individual products are classified according to the materials they’re made of and whether or not they’ve been fired or glazed.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""ceramic-tiles"">Ceramic tiles</h3><br/><br/><p>Ceramic tiles are generally classified under heading code 6907.

The following items are also excluded from Chapter 68:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>when the artificial stone contains resin and stone and the resin gives the essential character then they would be classified as plastics and covered in Chapter 39</li><br/>  <li>minerals in their raw state, for example unworked soapstone, are covered in Chapter 25</li><br/>  <li>slate pencils and slate drawing boards are covered in Chapter 96</li><br/>  <li>lithographic stones are covered in Chapter 84 under heading code 8442</li><br/>  <li>dental burrs are classified in Chapter 90 under heading code 9018</li><br/>  <li>worked items made of mineral carving materials such as amber, meerschaum and jet are covered in Chapter 96 under heading code 9602</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""hints-and-tips"">Hints and tips</h3><br/><br/><p>Chapter 68 and Chapter 69 cover between them articles made of ceramics and natural minerals. Fired ceramics are covered in Chapter 69, while unfired ceramics, natural stone and some artificial stone articles are covered in Chapter 68.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""materials-that-may-be-fired-or-unfired"">Materials that may be fired or unfired</h3><br/><br/><p>Some materials are used both in a fired and an unfired state to make certain articles. Sometimes, their uses are different depending on whether they have been fired or not.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, soapstone or steatite - is soft and is commonly carved into ornaments such as statuettes. These might be fired, in which case they’re covered in Chapter 69, or unfired, in which case they’re covered in Chapter 68. Fired soapstone is also used for making electrical insulators, but these are covered in Chapter 85 as electrical equipment.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""soapstone-jewellery"">Soapstone jewellery</h3><br/><br/><p>Soapstone is considered to be a ‘semi-precious’ stone, but it’s normally excluded from heading code 7103 (precious and semi-precious stones) by guidance in the Harmonised System Explanatory Note (<abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Note"">HSEN</abbr>) to Chapter 71 (Note B on page XIV-7103-2). You can buy <abbr title=""Harmonised System Explanatory Note"">HSENs</abbr> on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.wcoomd.org/"">World Customs Organisation website</a>.</p><br/><br/><p>Soapstone jewellery is classified under heading code 7116, while raw and unworked soapstone is covered in Chapter 25 under heading code 2526.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""artificial-stone"">Artificial stone</h3><br/><br/><p>‘Artificial stone’ is commonly made from crushed natural stone or other minerals mixed in with a poly resin binder. It is often moulded to make articles such as statuettes. Resin-bound artificial stone is classified according to whether the resin gives the articles their essential character. When the resin does not give the essential character then it is classified as an artificial of stone in Chapter 68. But if the resin gives articles their essential character then it is classified as a plastic article in Chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""glazes"">Glazes</h3><br/><br/><p>When classifying fired ceramics it often makes a difference whether they’re glazed or not. Glazed ceramics are usually smooth and shiny, while unglazed ceramics are generally duller and rougher.</p><br/><br/><p>‘Glazing’ includes methods of finishing fired ceramics using enamels, special glazes and so on that are covered in Chapter 32 under heading code 3207. It also includes salt glazing. This involves putting sodium chloride (salt) into the kiln during firing, where it ‘volatilises’ (evaporates) and the vapour reacts with the clay to form a glaze.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""functional-or-ornamental"">Functional or ornamental</h3><br/><br/><p>It is often necessary to decide whether a ceramic article is mainly functional or mainly ornamental (non-functional) to be able to classify it correctly.</p><br/><br/><p>Some items, such as bricks and bathroom fixtures, are obviously functional, so there’s no requirement to classify them according to whether they’re functional or ornamental - they have their own subheading codes. Other items are obviously only ornamental. A statuette, for example, serves no purpose other than decoration, so it’s classified as an ornamental ceramic item under heading code 6913.</p><br/><br/><p>However, some items - particularly house-wares - can be either functional or ornamental, often depending on their particular design. For example, a plate could be functional, but it could also be intended mainly for decoration.</p><br/><br/><p>To decide whether a ceramic article is mainly functional or mainly ornamental, consider whether a decorated version would work just as well as a plain undecorated one. If it would, then the decoration’s less important than the function and so it’s classified under heading code 6911 or heading code 6912, depending on what it’s made of.

There is no need to give personal details, and information that leads directly to an arrest could be considered for a small reward.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan, 61, originally from Edinburgh, was arrested at a swimming pool in Valencia on 10 August by the Guardia Civil. He fled the UK 12 years ago after being found guilty of smuggling 28.3 million cigarettes into the country. His crimes robbed the UK of around £4 million in duty and he was sentenced in his absence in December 2001.</p><br/><br/><p>McGowan was part of a wider conspiracy to smuggle around 56 million cigarettes into the UK between November 1999 and March 2000. Ten other men were involved in the plot, which robbed the UK taxpayer of over £8.2 million.</p><br/><br/><p>Adrian Farley, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said:</p><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>  <p class=""last-child"">McGowan is finally facing UK justice after 12 years on the run.

The upper does not include the tongue or any padding around the collar.</p><br/><br/><p>If the upper is made of more than one material then you have to decide which material covers the greatest external area. You should ignore any accessories and reinforcements like:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>ankle patches</li><br/>  <li>edging</li><br/>  <li>ornamentation</li><br/>  <li>buckles, tabs, eyelet stays and similar attachments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""the-outer-sole"">The outer sole</h3><br/><br/><p>The outer sole is the part of a shoe, boot, slipper or other item of footwear that comes into contact with the ground during use. The outer sole does not include any separate attached heel.</p><br/><br/><p>To establish what the outer sole is made of you have to identify the material that has the greatest surface area in contact with the ground. You should ignore any accessories and add-ons such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>spikes</li><br/>  <li>bars</li><br/>  <li>nails</li><br/>  <li>protectors and similar attachments</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""reinforcements"">Reinforcements</h3><br/><br/><p>Reinforcements are parts such as leather or plastic patches that are attached to the outside of the upper to give it extra strength. They may or may not be attached to the sole. To be treated as a reinforcement an attached part must cover material that’s suitable for use as an upper, not just lining material. If an attached part covers just a small area of lining material it’s treated as part of the upper and not as a reinforcement.</p><br/><br/><p>So that you can be sure of classifying footwear correctly it might be necessary for you to cut the external material to see what’s underneath it and find out which parts are reinforcements and which parts make up the real upper.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""other-useful-definitions"">Other useful definitions</h3><br/><br/><p>When you’re classifying footwear it’s useful to know what the other parts of a boot or shoe are called.</p><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/968/Footwear_guide3.gif"" alt=""Diagram: parts of a trainer""></div></figure><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>collar - the area that forms the rim of a boot’s or shoe’s upper</li><br/>  <li>eyelet - the reinforcement around the edge of a lace hole, usually made of metal or plastic</li><br/>  <li>eye stay - the area of a shoe or boot on which the eyelets are located</li><br/>  <li>foxing - a thin strip, often made of rubber, attached round the edge of some shoes and boots</li><br/>  <li>heel counter - a patch of material attached to the outside of the heel area of a boot’s or shoe’s upper to stiffen it</li><br/>  <li>heel tab - a patch of material attached to the outside of the heel area of a boot’s or shoe’s upper beneath the collar</li><br/>  <li>toe cap - a patch of material used to reinforce the outside of the toe area of the upper </li><br/>  <li>tongue - a flap of upper material attached to the vamp that covers the instep of the wearer - the tongue typically lies between and beneath the two eye stays</li><br/>  <li>vamp - the part of the upper behind the toe cap - the vamp can include the toe if the shoe or boot has no toe cap </li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""types-of-footwear"">Types of footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>When you classify footwear it’s important to identify what type of footwear it is and any particular purpose it might have.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes the upper is the part of the shoe that covers the sides and top of the foot.</p><br/><br/><p>Some of the more common types of footwear covered in chapter 64 are listed below:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>clogs - usually the uppers are made in one piece and are fixed to the soles by rivets; sometimes clogs are made in a single piece and do not have - or need - a separate, applied outer sole, in which case they’re classified according to the material they’re made from and not covered in this chapter</li><br/>  <li>espadrilles - these are also called beach shoes and have plaited fibre soles that are no thicker than 2.5 centimetres; they do not have heels</li><br/>  <li>flip-flops - these are also referred to as thongs; the thongs - or straps - are fixed by plugs that lock into holes in the sole</li><br/>  <li>hiking or walking boots - note that these are not classified as sports footwear</li><br/>  <li>Indian sandals - these have leather outer soles and leather uppers. The upper consists of straps that cross the instep and go around the big toe</li><br/>  <li>moccasins (American Indian type) - these use a single piece of material, traditionally soft leather, to form both the sole and the upper (or part of the upper); this makes it difficult to identify where the outer sole finishes and the upper begins</li><br/>  <li>neoprene footwear - this is typically used in diving and water sports; if the neoprene upper is covered or laminated with textile on both sides, then it’s classified as being made of textile; if the upper has no textile covering, or it’s covered only on one side, then it’s classified as being made of rubber</li><br/>  <li>safety footwear - footwear in which the toe caps are made of metal</li><br/>  <li>sandals - the front part of the upper (the vamp) consists either of straps or of material with one or more pieces cut out of it</li><br/>  <li>shoes - this term covers footwear, including trainers, that are not described elsewhere in this guide</li><br/>  <li>slippers - these include mules as well as other indoor footwear such as ballet slippers and ballroom dancing shoes; if the outer sole is made of plastic or rubber (approximately 1 centimetre thick) and then covered by a very thin, insubstantial layer of textile material, the slippers are classified as having ‘plastic/rubber’ outer soles; in some cases, all or part of the plastic or rubber outer sole is covered with a thicker, more durable textile material which is dotted with polyvinyl chloride (<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>) (this is to prevent the wearer from slipping) - these slippers are classified according to the material that has the most contact with the ground. If the slipper has a plastic or rubber sole that’s covered with a textile covering, the slipper can only be classified under heading code 6405 if the textile is proved to be durable. The durability of the textile can be proven by submitting the shoe for a martindale abrasion test and tested at 51,000 revolutions </li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>When you classify footwear there are some specific things that you need to think about.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""male-or-female-footwear"">Male or female footwear?</h3><br/><br/><p>Sometimes it’s difficult to determine whether the footwear is meant for men or women. It helps to think about the size, shape or style of the footwear. Remember that unisex footwear cannot be identified as either men’s or women’s footwear.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sizing"">Sizing</h3><br/><br/><p>Chapter 64 does not distinguish between adults or children’s footwear because adults can have small feet and children can have large feet. Instead, footwear is classified according to its size, specifically whether the length of the insole is more or less than 24 centimetres. Products that are identified depending on the length of the inside insole are classified under heading codes 6402 and 6403.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sports-footwear"">Sports footwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Some types of footwear are classified as sports footwear. This covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>footwear that has been designed for a sporting activity - it must have, or be able to have, features attached like spikes, sprigs, stops, clips or bars</li><br/>  <li>skating boots, ski boots, snowboard boots and cross-country ski footwear, snow boots, wrestling or boxing boots and cycling shoes</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Trainers are not classified as sports footwear unless they’re training shoes as specifically mentioned under heading code 6404 11.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""common-materials-used-to-make-footwear"">Common materials used to make footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>Products covered in this chapter can be made of any material except asbestos, which is classified in heading code 6812. Examples of materials commonly used in footwear include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>rubber</li><br/>  <li>plastics</li><br/>  <li>leather, composition leather and fur skin</li><br/>  <li>textiles - including felt and non-wovens</li><br/>  <li>plaiting materials</li><br/>  <li>wood</li><br/>  <li>cork</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Rubber and plastics include woven fabrics and other textiles with a visible external layer of one of these materials.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""plastic-sheeting"">Plastic sheeting</h3><br/><br/><p>This is any flat material made of plastics covered in chapter 39. It may be shaped by gluing, sewing, welding or moulding (vacuum forming).</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""cellular-plastic-sheeting"">Cellular plastic sheeting</h3><br/><br/><p>This is a type of plastic with many cells throughout the material. Cells can be open, closed or a mix. It’s commonly used in manufacturing footwear classified under heading code 6402. It’s often used as a substitute for leather and described as ‘imitation leather’, ‘synthetic leather’, ‘PU (polyurethane) leather’, ‘vinyl leather’ or ‘<abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr> leather’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""textile-material"">Textile material</h3><br/><p>This is any flat material made of woven or knitted textile fibres. Textile fibres include plastic strips less than 5 millimetres wide.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""artificial-straw-and-other-plaiting-materials"">Artificial straw and other plaiting materials</h3><br/><p>These materials are classified as textiles if they’re made of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>materials classified under heading code 5308 - yarn of other vegetable textile fibres, paper yarn</li><br/>  <li>materials classified under heading code 5404 - synthetic monofilament of 67 decitex or more and of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1 millimetre, strip and the like (for example artificial straw) of synthetic textile materials of an apparent width not exceeding 5 millimetres</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Footwear made of materials normally classified under heading code 5404 is classified under heading code 6404. But if the width of the fibres or strips is more than 1 millimetre (for synthetic monofilament) or more than 5 millimetres (for strip and the like) then the material is treated as ‘other material’ and the footwear is classified under heading code 6405.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""neoprene"">Neoprene</h3><br/><p>Neoprene is a cellular rubber with many cells throughout the material. Cells can be open, closed or a mix. It’s normally covered on at least one side by knitted textile fabric. Water sports footwear is often made from neoprene.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""leather-composition-leather-and-patent-leather"">Leather, composition leather and patent leather</h3><br/><p>Leather is the hide or skin of animals such as:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>cows and other bovine species</li><br/>  <li>goats and kids</li><br/>  <li>sheep and lambs - without their wool</li><br/>  <li>swine</li><br/>  <li>reptiles like snakes and crocodiles</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Animals used for leather must not be on the endangered species list. To check, contact the <abbr title=""Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora"">CITES</abbr> helpline on 0117 372 8749.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent leather is leather coated with a varnish, lacquer or pre-formed plastic sheet. It has a shiny, mirror-like surface. The varnish or lacquer used can be pigmented or non-pigmented and may be based on:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>vegetable oil that dries and hardens - linseed oil is normally used</li><br/>  <li>cellulose derivatives like nitro-cellulose</li><br/>  <li>synthetic products (including thermoplastics) - polyurethane plastics are normally used</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>If pre-formed plastic sheet is used to coat leather it’s usually made from polyurethane or <abbr title=""polyvinyl chloride"">PVC</abbr>.</p><br/><br/><p>The surface of patent leather is not necessarily smooth. It could be embossed - maybe to imitate crocodile skin - or artificially crushed, crinkled or grained. But it must still have a shiny, mirror-like finish.</p><br/><br/><p>To be classified as patent leather the thickness of the coating must not be more than 0.15 millimetres.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather coated with pigmented paint or lacquer to give a metallic sheen. These paints and lacquers consist of pigments like mica, silica and similar flakes in a binding substance like vegetable oil that dries and hardens, or plastic. Leather treated like this is known as ‘imitation metallised leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>Patent laminated leather is leather coated with a sheet of pre-formed plastic thicker than 0.15 millimetres but less than half the total thickness of the finished material. It has the same mirror-like finish as patent leather and is sometimes known as ‘patent coated leather’.</p><br/><br/><p>This group of materials also includes leather coated with metal powder or leaf - for example silver, gold or aluminium.</p><br/><br/><p>If leather is covered by a sheet of pre-formed plastic thicker than 0.15 millimetres, but more than half the total thickness of the finished material, then it’s covered in chapter 39.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""identifying-the-main-materials-used-in-footwear"">Identifying the main materials used in footwear</h2><br/><br/><p>When you’re identifying the correct commodity code for certain items of footwear, the first step is to establish the main material from which the upper is made.</p><br/><br/><p>The shoes in both the examples below are made from a combination of textile, leather and lining material. Only textile and leather are viable uppers for classification purposes. At first glance, the main material of the shoes in both examples seems easy to identify, but further examination reveals that this is not necessarily the case.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""shoe-apparently-made-mostly-of-textile"">Shoe apparently made mostly of textile</h3><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/967/Footwear_guide2.gif"" alt=""Diagram: a shoe apparently made mostly of textile""></div></figure><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather toe cap (1) and the leather toe vamp (2) reveals that there’s only insubstantial lining material underneath. This means that both these leather sections have to be considered as viable uppers.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather sections (3), (4), (5) and (6) reveals that there’s only lining material underneath. This shows that the textile upper material is not one continuous piece. Instead a number of individual sections of textile have been sewn onto the lining material and leather has been used to cover the areas of lining material where the pieces of textile do not meet. This means that all of the leather sections must be considered as viable uppers.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather side section (7) reveals that the textile material does not continue all the way down to the sole area. This side section also has to be considered as a viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The small leather section on the side of the shoe (8) is used for reinforcement and has textile, not lining material, underneath it. This means that the textile, and not the small leather section, is the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>Similarly, removing the logo (9) reveals textile, not lining material, underneath it. This means that the textile, and not the logo, is the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The examination has revealed that a greater area of the upper is made from leather than from textile. So in this example the shoe will be classified under heading code 6403.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""shoe-apparently-made-mostly-of-leather"">Shoe apparently made mostly of leather</h3><br/><br/><figure class=""image embedded""><div class=""img""><img src=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/966/Footwear_guide4.gif"" alt=""Diagram: a shoe apparently made mostly of leather""></div></figure><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather toe cap (1) and the leather toe vamp (2) reveals that there’s textile material underneath. This means that the textile must be considered as the viable upper and the toe cap and the vamp are just reinforcements.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather eye stay (3) reveals a large area of lining material and a small area of textile (marked A on the diagram) underneath. Because the textile does not extend all the way under the leather eye stay section - and because lining material is not substantial enough to be considered as a viable upper - the leather section must be considered as the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather section (4) reveals that it’s sewn on top of textile and that it also overlaps a small section (marked as A) of the leather eye stay (3). The leather eye stay has already been taken into account as a viable upper so the overlapping piece of the leather section cannot be counted. As there’s textile underneath the rest of the leather section, textile must be considered as the viable upper, and the whole of the leather section is treated as reinforcement.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing leather sections (5) and (7) and the logo (8) reveals textile underneath. This means that the textile is considered as the viable upper and the leather sections and logo are treated as reinforcements.</p><br/><br/><p>Removing the leather heel counter (6) reveals an area made up of textile and lining material. Because the textile does not extend all the way underneath the heel counter, the leather is considered as the viable upper.</p><br/><br/><p>The examination has revealed that a greater area of the upper is made from textile than from leather. So in this example the shoe will be classified under heading code 6404.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""footwear-parts-and-accessories"">Footwear parts and accessories</h2><br/><br/><p>Footwear parts are classified under heading code 6406. They can be made out of any material except asbestos, which is classified in chapter 68 under heading code 6812.</p><br/><br/><p>Footwear parts classified under heading code 6406 include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>parts of uppers, like toe caps and vamps, that are not attached to an outer sole. They can be stitched, glued or attached in some other way to an inner or middle sole, or insole</li><br/>  <li>pieces of leather that have been cut approximately to the shape of an upper</li><br/>  <li>stiffeners - these are pieces of hard material like plastic that are inserted into a shoe or boot between the heel or toe section and its reinforcement or lining; they’re designed to give these areas greater strength and rigidity</li><br/>  <li>inner and middle soles, and outer soles with no other shoe parts attached to them; if an outer sole does have another shoe part attached, it’s treated as a complete item of footwear and classified according to the material from which the outer sole and shoe part are made</li><br/>  <li>arch supports and insoles</li><br/>  <li>heels - these can be any type and made of any material; they could be designed to be glued, nailed, or screwed on. Heel parts, like top pieces, are also included</li><br/>  <li>studs, spikes and other similar items for sports footwear</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Two or more footwear parts assembled together are also classified under heading code 6406 as long as they do not essentially form a completed item of footwear. This is the case whether they’re attached to an inner sole or not.</p><br/><br/><p>Fittings that can be worn inside footwear are also classified as footwear parts under heading code 6406.

a chemically defined substance, a chemically defined group of substances, such as alkaloids, polyphenols or anthocyanins, or a plant extract - active substances must have medicinal properties to prevent or treat specific diseases and ailments, or their symptoms</li><br/>  <li>excipient - a non-nutritional substance (like magnesium stearate) added during the production of tablets</li><br/>  <li>herbal medicinal preparations - these are preparations based on one or more active substances, these are obtained from a plant, or parts of a plant, by a process such as drying, crushing, extraction or purification</li><br/>  <li>homeopathic medicinal preparations - these are prepared from products, substances or compositions called ‘homeopathic stocks’ or ‘mother tinctures’, these mother tinctures are diluted - for example in alcohol or water, the degree of dilution must be shown (for example D6)</li><br/>  <li>Provitamin</li><br/>  <li>Recommended Daily Allowance (<abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr>)</li><br/>  <li>vitamins or mineral preparations - these are preparations based on vitamins that are covered under heading code 2936, or based on minerals, including trace elements, and mixtures of minerals, they’re used to treat or prevent specific diseases or ailments, or their symptoms - this type of preparation contains a much higher amount of vitamins or minerals, generally at least 3 times higher than the <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-miscellaneous-food-preparations"">Classifying miscellaneous food preparations</h2><br/><br/><p>Products that do not treat, cure or prevent diseases or ailments are generally classified under heading code 2106 as food preparations not elsewhere specified or included.</p><br/><br/><p>Many items are classified under this heading code, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>mixtures of plants, or parts of plants, with other ingredients, like plant extracts, but these mixtures are not consumed in this form, and are used to make herbal teas and infusions, they may have a particular purpose, for example to be used as a laxative, purgative or diuretic, or to relieve flatulence, but others claim to provide relief from ailments or to promote general health or well-being</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of ginseng extract with other ingredients to make ginseng tea or drink</li><br/>  <li>food or dietary supplements that are based on substances like plant extracts, fruit concentrates, honey or fructose and that contain added vitamins, but the packaging of these preparations often indicates that they’re beneficial in maintaining general health or well-being</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Although many products like vitamins are usually classified under this heading, it’s important to take into account:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the actual contents of the product</li><br/>  <li>how the product is made up, presented or labelled</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These may mean that a product is classified under a different heading. For example, vitamins that are mixed with water and other ingredients and are ready for immediate consumption as drinks or tonics are not covered under heading code 2106. Instead they’re covered in chapter 22.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-tonics-and-liquid-food-supplements"">Classifying tonics and liquid food supplements</h2><br/><br/><p>Chapter 22 covers tonics and liquid food supplements that are meant for immediate consumption. These preparations contain added vitamins or iron compounds and are designed to maintain general health or well-being. This type of product is generally covered under one of the following heading codes:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>heading code 2202 - non-alcoholic beverages</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2205 - aromatised wines</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2206 - mixtures of fermented beverages, mixtures of fermented beverages with non-alcoholic beverages and other fermented beverages</li><br/>  <li>heading code 2208 - spirituous beverages, this includes products like tonic wine fortified with herbal extracts or vitamins, and liquid herbal remedies with a basis of distilled alcohol - these are included under this heading even if they’re meant to be taken in very small quantities</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-provitamins-and-vitamins-chapter-29"">Classifying provitamins and vitamins (chapter 29)</h2><br/><br/><p>Separately defined organic compounds, like vitamins, are covered in chapter 29. To be covered in this chapter they must comply with strict conditions that specify the additives that are allowed.</p><br/><br/><p>These compounds can be dissolved in water or in some other solvent, but the solution must be used only because it’s required for safety reasons or for transport purposes. Stabilisers, such as anti-caking agents, can also be added, but only to preserve the compound or for transport purposes.</p><br/><br/><p>For example an essential trace element like chromium picolinate is prepared as a dietary supplement in the form of tablets or capsules, it would not be covered in this chapter. This is because the added ingredients, like binder, the capsule shell and excipients, have not been added just for the purposes of preservation or transport.</p><br/><br/><p>This type of product is covered in chapter 21 under heading 2106.</p><br/><br/><p>Heading 2936 specifically covers:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>provitamins</li><br/>  <li>vitamins</li><br/>  <li>derivatives used mainly as vitamins</li><br/>  <li>mixtures of provitamins, vitamins and vitamin derivatives</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Certain specified additives, such as antioxidants, are allowed provided that the amount added is just enough for the vitamins to be preserved or transported.</p><br/><br/><p>For classification purposes it’s very important that anything added to a compound does not make the resulting product particularly suitable for a specific use rather than for general use.</p><br/><br/><p>For example if vitamins are prepared as food supplements in the form of tablets, capsules or caplets then they’re not classified under heading code 2936. Because of the way they’re presented, with an intended daily dosage, they’re considered to be suitable for a specific use.</p><br/><br/><p>They’re also excluded from this heading code because the purpose of the additives is for more than just preserving or transporting the vitamins. The additives are there to give the product a convenient and easy to use form.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-herbal-medicinal-preparations"">Classifying herbal medicinal preparations</h2><br/><br/><p>Herbal medicinal preparations, or medicaments, are covered in chapter 30 under heading codes 3003 and 3004. These include preparations used (either internally or externally) to treat or prevent human or animal diseases or ailments. Products that maintain general health and well-being are specifically excluded from this chapter.</p><br/><br/><p>If a medicinal preparation is made up into measured doses, like ampoules, syringes or capsules, then these must be classified under heading code 3004.</p><br/><br/><p>This heading code also specifically covers the retail sale of:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>herbal and homoeopathic medicinal preparations</li><br/>  <li>certain preparations containing vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids or fatty acids</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>These products must include certain information for consumers on their labels or packaging, or on the accompanying user directions. This information must show:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the specific diseases, ailments or deficiencies (or their symptoms) for which the product is to be used</li><br/>  <li>the concentration of the active substances that the product is based on</li><br/>  <li>the dosage</li><br/>  <li>mode of application</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>The level of vitamins and minerals in these products must be much higher than the <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> of these substances for just maintaining general health or well-being.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""specific-exclusions-from-chapter-29"">Specific exclusions from chapter 29</h3><br/><br/><p>Heading code 2936 covers provitamins and vitamins, to which certain permitted substances can be added, for example stabilisers. The following products are specifically excluded from this heading code.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that are particularly suitable for specific use, for example vitamins that are made up as food supplements in the form of capsules, tablets, caplets and so on which have a recommended daily dosage. These are considered to be suitable for specific use and so are covered elsewhere.</p><br/><br/><p>Products that contain more ingredients than just the additives that are permitted for preserving or transporting the compound, for example, vitamins that have been mixed with other organic chemicals, minerals, herbs, other parts of plants, food ingredients and similar substances.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""animal-feed-supplements"">Animal feed supplements</h3><br/><br/><p>Feed supplements for animals that contain vitamins and other ingredients, such as cereals and proteins are covered in chapter 23 under heading code 2309. This heading code specifically excludes vitamins that just have permitted substances such as stabilisers added to them and which are meant for general rather than specific use. These are covered in chapter 29 under heading code 2936.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""recommended-daily-allowance-rda"">Recommended Daily Allowance (<abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr>)</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""rda-for-vitamins""><br/><abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> for vitamins</h3><br/><br/><p>An <abbr title=""Recommended Daily Allowance"">RDA</abbr> is set for certain vitamins and minerals.

If your (or another person’s) entitlement to act as legal personal representative is based on intestacy you will need to prove your (or their) relationship by supplying the birth and marriage certificates which prove you (or they) are that person’s personal representative.   You will also need to confirm the dates of death of anyone entitled to act as a personal representative when you submit a claim (see Order of priority to share to an intestate estate above) as well as supplying copies of search results for a grant to the estate concerned which can be obtained from <a rel=""external"" href=""https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills"">Find a will</a></p><br/><br/><p>For example, if you are a nephew of someone whose estate has been dealt with by BVD but your father (the deceased’s brother) survived the deceased but has since died then it is your father’s estate that is entitled to claim and share in the deceased’s estate. Any claim to the deceased’s estate would have to be made by your father’s personal representative (see ‘Definition of a personal representative’ above).   If your father left a valid will, his personal representative will be the person named on the grant of probate to the will or, if probate was not granted, the executor of the will.</p><br/><br/><p>If your father did not leave a will, it will be the person named on the grant of letters of administration to his estate or the person entitled to deal with his intestate estate (see ‘Order of priority to share in an intestate estate’ above).</p><br/><br/><p>You would only be entitled to claim the deceased’s estate if you are your father’s personal representative.</p><br/><br/><p>For example, if your father died without leaving a will and there is no grant of letters of administration to his estate and he was married at the time of his death, it will be his spouse who will be his personal representative. If she has since died then it will be her legal personal representative who will be entitled to make a claim to the deceased’s estate (and her personal representative will be determined in the same way as set out in the ‘Definition of a personal representative section).   If you are in any doubt about your entitlement to claim the estate, you should either seek your own legal advice or send a family tree, including the dates of death of family members on it, to:</p><br/><div class=""contact "" id=""contact_3097""><br/>  <div class=""content""><br/>    <h3>BVD - Estates</h3><br/><br/>    <div class=""vcard contact-inner""><br/><br/>        <div class=""email-url-number""><br/>            <p class=""email""><br/>              <span class=""type"">Email</span><br/>              <a class=""email"" href=""mailto:bvestates@governmentlegal.gov.uk"">bvestates@governmentlegal.gov.uk</a><br/>            </p><br/>        </div><br/><br/><br/>    </div><br/>  </div><br/></div><br/><br/><p>You can check whether a grant of Probate or Letters of Administration has been issued using the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills"">probate search service</a> and obtain court sealed copies of these by making a postal application to the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance/searching-for-probate-records"">Probate Registry</a></p><br/><br/><h2 id=""illegitimacy"">Illegitimacy</h2><br/><br/><p>Illegitimacy (when a child is born to parents who were not married at the time of his or her birth and they did not subsequently marry) as a bar to intestate succession was removed by the Family Law Reform Act 1987.  This means illegitimacy is irrelevant if someone dies on or after 4 April 1988 and their estate can be claimed by those relatives defined by the Administration of Estates Act 1925 whether they were illegitimate or not.</p><br/><br/><p>If a deceased person died intestate before 4 April 1988 and was illegitimate, the only persons who are entitled to share in their estate before the Crown are their spouse, children (or their descendants) and parents.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""adoptions"">Adoptions</h2><br/><br/><p>Only adoptions made by Court Order under the Adoption Act (or foreign adoptions recognised by English law) have any legal effect for the purposes of succession.  Such an adopted person becomes, for the purposes of succession, the child of his or her adoptive parents and ceases to have any interest in his or her natural family.  Legal adoptions have been possible only since 1 January 1927.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""time-limits-for-claiming-estates-administered-by-bvd"">Time limits for claiming Estates Administered by BVD</h2><br/><br/><p>Claims will be accepted by BVD within, generally, 12 years from the date that the administration of the estate was completed and interest will be paid on the money held.</p><br/><br/><p>However, BVD will admit fully documented claims up to 30 years from the date of death, subject to no interest being paid on the money held, if the claim is received after the 12 year period above has run out.</p><br/><br/><p>Fully documented claims (including documents of ID and personal representative documents) must be received within 30 years of the date of death.  If BVD receives a claim whether fully documented or not, outside the 30 year time limit it will not be considered.  If an incomplete claim is received, you must supply the documents required to complete the claim within the 30 year time limit or the claim will not be considered.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""genealogists"">Genealogists</h2><br/><br/><p>Genealogists are private companies who trace potentially entitled relatives for commercial gain. They do not work for, on or behalf of, BVD but often make enquiries for relatives after BVD advertises an estate.   You do not have to use a genealogist’s services to make a claim to BVD if you do not wish to do so, and such a decision does not affect any entitlement you may have to share in an estate.</p><br/><br/><p>If you are contacted by a genealogist, it is up to you whether you use their services and BVD will not advise you in this respect.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""make-a-claim-to-bvd"">Make a claim to BVD</h2><br/><br/><p>BVD publishes a list of all estates which have yet to be claimed. This list is updated daily, with new estates added.   Any estates which have been claimed, or where a will has been located, or where the time limit for making  a claim has run out or the estate is insolvent are removed from the list.</p><br/><br/><p>If you believe you are entitled to claim an estate which has been dealt with by BVD, please send a family tree which shows how you are related to the person who has died, and include the dates of birth, marriage and death of all those on the tree.  If it appears that you may be entitled to claim the estate, BVD will then ask you to supply documentary evidence that proves your entitlement.</p><br/><br/><p>This will include:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>full birth certificates (showing the parents’ names) and marriage certificates of each person  between you and the deceased (including yours and the deceased’s).</li><br/>  <li>identification documents which provide proof of your name and of your name linked to your address (see a <a href=""#identity-documents"">list of acceptable ID documents</a> at the end of this guide)</li><br/>  <li>a full explanation, supported by evidence, of any discrepancies in the documents supplied with your claim or about any missing documents  but you should note that these may affect the acceptance of your claim</li><br/>  <li>if you are a third party who represents a claimant you will also need to provide written confirmation that you have been instructed by the claimant to make a claim. This could be in the form of a contract signed by the claimant provided it contains a clause confirming that the claimant has instructed your firm to make a claim on their behalf, or in a separate letter of authority signed by the claimant to this effect.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>BVD may also ask you for other evidence if needed. If additional evidence includes <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/census-records/"">census returns</a> or the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/1939-register/"">1939 Register</a>, this should be a copy of the actual return not an online transcript of the information contained on the return.</p><br/><br/><p>If you are in any doubt about how to prove your claim, you should seek your own advice, from a solicitor, local law centre or the Citizen’s Advice Bureau.

BVD will generally deal with the first fully documented claim received.  If a claim that is incomplete is received first and is then followed by a fully documented claim from someone else – the fully documented claim will be dealt with.</p><br/><br/><p>If BVD receive a fully documented claim and subsequently receive a claim from a relative who is higher up the order of priority (see ‘Order of priority to share in an intestate estate’), that claim will be considered before the first claim received’</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""obtaining-documents-for-your-claim"">Obtaining documents for your claim</h2><br/><br/><p>Certificates issued in the United Kingdom can be obtained from the local registrar where the event took place or as follows:</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""england-and-wales"">England and Wales</h3><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>General Register Office<br/><br>PO Box 2<br/><br>Southport<br/><br>Merseyside<br/><br>PR8 2JD <br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further information can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.direct.gov.uk/gro"">General Register Office</a> website.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""scotland"">Scotland</h3><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>Register General<br/><br>General Registration Unit<br/><br>Room 44<br/><br>New Register House<br/><br>Edinburgh<br/><br>EH1 3YT<br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk"">Scottish General Register Office</a> website</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""northern-ireland"">Northern Ireland</h3><br/><br/><p>Before 1922:</p><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>General Register Office<br/><br>Government Offices<br/><br>Roscommon<br/><br>Republic of Ireland <br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.groireland.ie"">Republic of Ireland General Register Office</a> website.</p><br/><br/><p>After 1922:</p><br/><br/><div class=""address""><div class=""adr org fn""><p><br/><br/>Register General for Northern Ireland<br/><br>Oxford House<br/><br>49-55 Chichester Street<br/><br>Belfast<br/><br>BT1 4HL<br/><br><br/></p></div></div><br/><br/><p>Further details can be found on the <a rel=""external"" href=""http://www.groni.gov.uk"">Register General for Northern Ireland</a> website.</p><br/><br/><p>BVD cannot assist you in obtaining documents or certificates from overseas and you should take your own legal advice as necessary.

The fabric used can be unbleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed. Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours.</p><br/><br/><p>Additionally if sewn-on ribbing of a different fabric is present on any of the components, the set is excluded from classification as an ensemble.</p><br/><br/><p>The packaging can take various forms and each component can be in its own packaging, but when presented to Customs, the ensemble must be presented as a single unit in a form ready for retail sale. Retail packaging includes plain poly bags, labelled retail poly bags or boxes containing one ensemble. The two parts of the set must be packaged together in their own bag. Using adhesive tape to bind two poly bags together does not qualify.

A garment that covers both the upper and lower parts of the body, such as one which falls from the shoulders down to below mid-thigh, cannot form part of an ensemble.  However, there are specific exceptions where ensembles include two upper garments, one of which is a pullover that presented together form a twinset. A lower garment must also be included. Waistcoats may form a second upper garment of an ensemble classified under chapter 61 and chapter 62.

If the whole of the front side is not one single fabric, it should be classified according to its predominant material over the whole of the glove. Some sports gloves are an exception. If their essential character is defined by a material on a different part (for example, a goalkeeper’s gloves used for ice hockey where the fabric on the back protects the hand) they should be classified under that material.</p><br/><br/><p>Some other gloves are classified elsewhere:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>gloves lined with fur skin, artificial fur or with fur skin or artificial fur on the outside other than as trimming are classified under heading codes 4303 or 4304</li><br/>  <li>gloves or mitts for babies are classified under heading codes 6111 or 6209</li><br/>  <li>friction gloves for massage or toilet use are classified under heading code 6302</li><br/>  <li>loofah friction gloves are classified under heading code 4602</li><br/>  <li>gloves, mittens and mitts made from paper, cellulose wadding or web of cellulose fibres are classified under heading code 4818</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><h3 id=""legwarmers"">Legwarmers</h3><br/><br/><p>These items that do not cover the feet are classified under heading code 6406.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""bra-extensions"">Bra extensions</h3><br/><br/><p>These consist of a strip of textile material of about 3.5 cm wide and 7 cm in length and have hooks at one end and eyes on the other end, both of base metal. It can be attached to the backside of a bra. A bra extension does not only prolong a bra, but it mainly enables women who cannot wear universal sizes, to wear a bra. This allows a bra to fulfil its function as body support by adapting it to women who cannot use universal sizes. The bra extension is classified to heading 6217.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""classifying-specialist-clothing"">Classifying specialist clothing</h2><br/><br/><h3 id=""sports-bras"">Sports bras</h3><br/><br/><p>To be correctly classified as a sports bra under heading 6212, it has to have a clear definition of cups or separation of the breasts. The separation can be in the form of clear individual cups or merely stitching or rucking/gathering of material between the breasts. The garment is designed to cover the upper part of the body and extend down to just below the bust, with a body supporting function. This garment is designed to be worn next to the skin as an undergarment.</p><br/><br/><p>If the bra consists of merely elastin around the bottom of the bra with no separation of the breasts, it would not be classified to this heading.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""nightwear"">Nightwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Men’s or boys’ pyjamas are classified under subheading codes 6107 21 00 to 6107 29 00, or 6207 21 00 to 6207 29 00 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Women’s or girls’ pyjamas are classified under subheading codes 6108 31 00 to 6108 39 00, or 6208 21 00 to 6208 29 00 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>In general terms, to be classified as pyjamas the garments must be clearly identifiable as intended exclusively or mainly as nightwear.</p><br/><br/><p>Pyjamas comprise two garments - one for the upper part of the body, generally a jacket-type garment or pullover and another for the lower part of the body, usually trousers or shorts of a simple cut. The components must be of corresponding or compatible size and of matching cut, constituent fabric, colours, decorations and degree of finish to show clearly that they are designed to be worn together. They must be of a suitable fabric to wear at night, have a loose fitting cut and not have any potentially uncomfortable features such as large or bulky buttons nor excessive applied decorations.</p><br/><br/><p>Pyjama trousers when presented without an upper garment, and Chinese style satin pyjamas, cannot be classified as nightwear. Sets of knitted garments comprising a pair of shorts and a T-shirt-style upper are not classified as pyjamas. However, sets of garments known as ‘baby dolls’, comprising a very short nightdress and matching briefs, can be classified as pyjamas.</p><br/><br/><p>Nightdresses are defined as being:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>between less than knee length to ankle length</li><br/>  <li>made from either light or heavy fabric</li><br/>  <li>garments made from light fabrics may be elaborately decorated with lace ribbons, piping, gathers, bows or embroidery</li><br/>  <li>those made from heavier fabrics are generally more simply styled but may be brushed and/or printed and have some decoration</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>They cannot be classified as nightdresses if the garments have:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>linings</li><br/>  <li>fastening cords or ribbons with decorative attachments (for example, of metal) that would make them unsuitable for wearing in bed</li><br/>  <li>ribbons, laces or cords for tying at the back of the neck</li><br/>  <li>excessive elastication at the top of the garment or substantial gathering at the waist that would make it uncomfortable to wear in bed</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Lightweight loose fitting long T-shirt style garments and those that have any features that would make them uncomfortable or unsuitable to wear in bed, whether they look like nightdresses or not, cannot be classified as such, even if they’re decorated with night-time themes.</p><br/><br/><p>One-piece nightwear that covers both the upper and lower body and envelops each leg separately are covered later in the chapter - heading codes 6107 91 to 6107 99, or 6207 91 to 6207 99 for men’s or boys’, headings codes 6108 91 to 6108 99, or 6208 91 to 6208 99 for women’s or girls’.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""industrial-and-occupational-clothing"">Industrial and occupational clothing</h3><br/><br/><p>Industrial and occupational clothing - items worn solely or mainly to provide protection (physical or health) and made from tough or non-shrink fabric - is usually classified under chapter 62.</p><br/><br/><p>Usually these types of clothing do not feature decoration, other than perhaps marks or indications of the intended purpose of the clothing. Usually made from cotton, synthetic or artificial fibres or a mixture of these textiles, they feature safety seams or double seams to increase their strength and are often fastened with press studs, zips, Velcro strips or crossed or knotted closure using laces or similar items.</p><br/><br/><p>Pockets are generally stitched on and slit pockets are usually made of the same fabric as the garment.</p><br/><br/><p>Only garments of a commercial size of 158 (having a body height of 158 centimetres) or more can be considered industrial or occupational garments. Uniforms and official garments (such as judges’ gowns or church vestments) are not considered industrial or occupational garments.</p><br/><br/><p>Typical industrial occupational clothing, such as boiler suits or coveralls, is used by mechanics, factory workers, bricklayers, farmers, etc. It also includes aprons and dust coats for doctors, nurses, charwomen, hairdressers, bakers and butchers.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""babies-garments-and-clothing-accessories"">Babies’ garments and clothing accessories</h3><br/><br/><p>Babies’ garments are classified under heading codes 6111 and 6209 as appropriate. They must be intended for infants of a body height not more than 86 centimetres (commercial size 86). This applies even if features such as the method of fastening would, for identical garments above commercial size 86, require classification as boys’ or girls’ garments.</p><br/><br/><p>Layette articles - garments clearly designed for newborn babies - should always be classified under these headings, regardless of their dimensions. For example, christening robes and gowns, capes, pixie suits or babies’ booties without applied soles.</p><br/><br/><p>Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 651/2007, sleeping bags with sleeves or armholes designed for children or adults (ie over 86 centimetres) are excluded from 6111 or 6209 and classified under codes covering ‘other garments’ under 6114 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>There are specific and detailed measurements that define the maximum sizes of many garment types for them to fall into commercial size 86 centimetres.</p><br/><br/><h4

All chest measurements are taken from armholes with the garment in its relaxed (unstretched) position.<br/>2. Measurements 22 and 23 are taken inside the garment when quilted or padded.<br/>3. Where a garment is fitted with adjustable straps, the straps should be positioned either on the buttonhole giving the shortest adjustment, or with a moveable buckle or clasp positioned 8cm from the unattached end of the strap.<br/>4. Measurements 10 and 15 are taken to a fixed leg end, ie lengths should not exceed those specified to allow for unfixed roll-up or turned up.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""track-suits-and-ski-suits"">Track suits and ski suits</h3><br/><br/><p>Track suits are defined by the general appearance and nature of their fabric and the fact they are clearly meant to be worn exclusively or mainly for sporting activities. They are classified under heading codes 6112 or 6211 as appropriate. Bear in mind however that there are different criteria for knitted and woven track suits.</p><br/><br/><p>Track suits comprise two garments:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>A garment to cover the upper part of the body down to, or slightly below, the waist. This garment:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>has long sleeves with ribbed or elasticised bands, zip fasteners or other tightening elements at the cuffs</li><br/>      <li>has similar tightening elements, also including drawstrings, are usually found at the bottom of the garment</li><br/>      <li>is with or without an opening or have a complete or partial opening at the front</li><br/>      <li>if a complete opening at the front, the fastening system must be a zip, press studs or velcro</li><br/>      <li>if the opening is partial, it may in some circumstances be fastened with any type of buttons</li><br/>      <li>may be fitted with a hood, collar or pockets</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/>  <li>A garment - a pair of trousers - which will be:<br/>    <ul><br/>      <li>either close or loose fitting</li><br/>      <li>with or without pockets</li><br/>      <li>with an elasticated waistband, drawstring or other means of tightening at the waist</li><br/>      <li>with no opening at the waist and therefore no buttons or other fastening systems</li><br/>      <li>with or without foot straps.</li><br/>    </ul><br/>  </li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>The trousers may also be fitted with ribbed or elasticated bands, slide fasteners (zippers) or other tightening elements at the bottom of trouser legs which generally go to ankle level.</p><br/><br/><p>Knitted tracksuits must not be lined, but the inner surface of the fabric may be raised (napped).</p><br/><br/><p>Woven tracksuits may be lined. Components of a tracksuit made up with an outer shell of a single identical fabric should be classified under one heading under heading code 6211. Sets of garments such as shell suits whose components are made up in separate fabrics - even if the only difference is colour - must be separately classified as upper and lower parts under heading code 6211.</p><br/><br/><p>Ski suits, defined as garments or sets of garments that, given their appearance and fabric, are clearly intended to be worn principally for cross country or alpine skiing, are classified under heading codes 6112 and 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>They comprise either:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>A ski overall - a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and lower parts of the body. In addition to sleeves and collars, they may also include pockets or footstraps.</li><br/>  <li>A ski ensemble - a set of garments made up of two or three pieces and put up together for retail sale that includes one garment such as an anorak, windcheater, wind jacket or similar, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly also including a waistcoat and a pair of trousers, breeches or a bib and brace overall.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>The ski ensemble may also consist of the overall described above with a type of padded, sleeveless jacket.</p><br/><br/><p>All the components of a ski ensemble must be made up of the same texture, style and composition and be of corresponding or compatible size. They can however be of different colours.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""swimwear"">Swimwear</h3><br/><br/><p>Swimwear is defined as garments that, given their general appearance, cut and nature of fabric, are recognisably intended to be worn solely or mainly as swimwear. They’re generally made of man-made fibres and are classified under heading codes 6112 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts must have inner briefs sewn to the garment or a least a lining in the front of the crotch and be tight at the waist, such as having a drawstring or fully elasticated waist.</p><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts may have pockets, provided that:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>the outside pockets have a firm fastening system to close the pocket completely, such as a zip or velcro</li><br/>  <li>the inside pockets are fixed to the waist and have an overlap closing system that must assure complete closure of the pocket opening</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Swimming shorts cannot have a front opening or opening at the waist, even if closed with a closing system.</p><br/><br/><p>Unless all these conditions are met, the garments must be classified as shorts under heading codes 6103, 6104, 6203 or 6204.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""asian-garments-and-turbans"">Asian garments and turbans</h3><br/><br/><p>Saris are designed to be worn draped around the body from the shoulder to the ankles. They cover part of the upper body and the whole of the lower body. They are made from woven fabric and are classified under heading code 6211 if they meet the criteria stated below. They’re worn with a choli, or blouse, which covers the shoulders and the bust, and a waist petticoat.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris are rectangular pieces of woven fabric approximately 4.5 to 5.5m in length and 122 centimetres wide. They’re made from lightweight fabrics of silk, cotton or man-made fibres but are not made of wool. They have two selvedges running along the length of the fabric. In order to be classified as a garment, at least one of the two shorter edges must be finished off by hemming, fringing, drawn thread work or any other method specified in Note 7 to Section XI of the Tariff.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris with two selvedges and two raw ends are classified as fabric in the piece even though they may be wearable in this form.</p><br/><br/><p>Saris may be made in any colour, plain or with any form of decoration or pattern including embroidery, hand printing or embellishments of gold and silver thread.</p><br/><br/><p>The methods of manufacture and appearance of the principle types of saris entering into international trade are:</p><br/><br/><ol><br/>  <li>Silk saris made on a hand loom with a contrasting border along one edge of the length of the fabric. In some cases, the end design to be worn across the shoulder also has a contrasting border and knotted fringe, while the remaining two sides may be decorated, frequently to a lesser degree. These articles are usually made individually and are mainly imported from India.</li><br/>  <li>Machine-made artificial silk saris of rayon. These are often embellished with yarns of different colours to imitate embroidery and may be finished by fringing or drawn thread work.</li><br/>  <li>Machine-made, continuous fibre, polyester and georgette saris. Usually patterned all over, these are made in the length, cut to size and hemmed at both ends. They are imported mainly from Hong Kong and Japan.</li><br/></ol><br/><br/><p>Occasionally a sari is approximately one metre longer than the standard length. This additional piece of material may be detached by the wearer and used to make the choli, or blouse, referred to above.</p><br/><br/><p>The point of division between the sari proper and the additional piece is made obvious by a line of drawn thread work across the width of the fabric or by a change in the pattern. Such ‘composite’ articles are classified as saris providing at least one of the shorter ends is made up within the terms of Note 7 to Section XI of the Tariff.  In other cases, they are to be classified as fabric in the piece.</p><br/><br/><p>Other products (for example, shawls) that are imported in a similar condition are classified as ‘made-up’ articles (for example, as shawls under heading code 6214) or piece goods according to these criteria.</p><br/><br/><p>The choli is a short top, which does not reach the waist. It is usually classified as an ‘other garment’ under heading 6114 or 6211 as appropriate.</p><br/><br/><p>Kurta salwar or shalwar kameez are not usually classified as suits or ensembles. A kameez is a garment designed to cover the body from the shoulders to the knee, although in some cases this garment may be slightly shorter. It’s usually classified as a dress under heading codes 6104 or 6204 as appropriate.

95.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""hints-and-tips"">Hints and tips</h3><br/><br/><p>As with many commodities, the greater your depth of knowledge about the goods, the easier it is to correctly classify them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""know-your-fabrics"">Know your fabrics</h3><br/><br/><p>The Tariff makes a significant distinction between garments that are knitted and crocheted and garments that are not. The former are classified under chapter 61, while the latter are classified under chapter 62.</p><br/><br/><p>If you’re not sure of the fabric with which your goods are manufactured, then it’s a good idea to check with your supplier before you attempt to import them.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""sexing-garments"">Sexing garments</h3><br/><br/><p>Throughout chapter 61 and chapter 62, garments with a left over right closure at the front are regarded as men’s or boys’ garments and those with right over left closure at the front as women’s and girls’ garments, unless the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one sex or the other.</p><br/><br/><p>Where garments cannot be identified as for either sex, they must be classified in the headings covering women’s or girls’ garments.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""follow-fashions"">Follow fashions</h3><br/><br/><p>The definitions of many garments are very precise and a change in fashions may in turn lead to a change in classification. For example if your new line of T-shirts has a collar, you would need to classify it as a pullover instead.</p><br/><br/><p>When specifications and features of garments change, it’s essential to check that they do not have to be classified somewhere different than you’re used to.</p><br/><br/><h3 id=""getting-groups-right"">Getting groups right</h3><br/><br/><p>The classification rules for suits and ensembles are precise and detailed. You cannot classify something as a suit or an ensemble unless precise criteria are used. One particular requirement is that the upper and lower garments must be made entirely from one type of fabric, ie no panels of different colours or construction. There are also detailed rules on how they must be presented at customs to qualify as an ensemble.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""further-help"">Further help</h2><br/><br/><p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff"">Use the online UK Trade Tariff tool</a> to find the rest of your commodity code and other measures applying to imports and exports.</p><br/><br/><p>If you cannot find the information you need on this page, you can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/finding-commodity-codes-for-imports-or-exports"">get more help to find the right commodity code for your goods</a>.</p><br/></div></p>",

If a passenger travels in more than one class on their journey, the standard rate is due on the whole journey.</p><br/><br/><p>It does not matter how many flights passengers take to reach their destination, as long as the flights are connected. Connected flights must be shown on the <a href=""#tick-inf"">same ticket or on conjunction tickets</a> and meet the time-related rules.</p><br/><br/><p>In all cases, the plane operator for the first flight pays duty on the whole journey.</p><br/><br/><p>If the first flight of a connected journey is <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exemptions-from-air-passenger-duty#passengers-on-connecting-flights"">exempt</a>, then the whole journey is exempt from duty.</p><br/><br/><p>There are different rules used to work out if flights are connected, depending on whether they’re domestic or international connections. The 4 types of flights are:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/>  <li>a domestic connection where both are UK domestic flights</li><br/>  <li>a domestic connection from an international flight to a domestic flight</li><br/>  <li>an international connection with a domestic UK flight to an international flight</li><br/>  <li>an international connection with an international flight to another international flight</li><br/></ul><br/><br/><p>Flights to and from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are international for Air Passenger Duty purposes, as they’re not part of the UK.</p><br/><br/><h2 id=""domestic-connections"">Domestic connections</h2><br/><br/><p>Flights are classified as connecting based on the arrival time of the first flight and the departure time of the second flight.
